I read the cleaning instructions label carefully. followed them closely. and still, the dye ran and stained some of my colored clothes. pi**ed me off! just after the first wash and even before wearing them, i have streaks of uneven color on the pants. bad quality material or dye is what causes this. now i have to go and see if i can even get out my other stained clothes. thanks a lot retailer.	0
"As always, these ag stevies are perfect. i was worried they would run small, but they are true to size on me. i'm about 5'2"" and ordered the petite length and the length looks like the model on me. just above the ankles."	1
Saw this in store and knew i gotta have it! beautiful colors and slimming effect.	1
Gorgeous with that retailer uniqueness. unfortunately this shade of yellow just wasn't right for me. but it is a beautiful dress	1
"I bought the black and love it. i bought both the medium and large but am going to keep the medium. it was plenty roomy. i'm 5'2"" and about fluctuate between 125-130 lbs. i usually wear a medium or large in retailer-wear but i like things roomy. have to hide a little extra these days!"	1
I bought this mostly to wear around the house, so i'll keep it because i got it on a pretty good sale. that said, this runs really large. the sleeves are really loose, and it doesn't really hang well over my hips, which is a shame. it's very soft and cozy, which is nice, but i don't think i'll leave the house in it often. it also arrived with a hole in the ribbing on the bottom of the front panel. i was able to tie a knot through one of the loops that i think will prevent further unraveling, bu	0
I love that this tee is so soft and is not boring! when i originally took it out of the bag, my teenage daughter did not like it. then i tried it on and she was wowed! the longer length in the back makes it very interesting. i am looking forward to wearing this with jeans.	1
This sweatshirt is very comfortable and the length of the sleeves is very generous! the bodice is short so you may have to wear a camisole or tank top to avoid exposing your tummy. i usually purchase medium sized tops but had to return for an xl! this runs very small.	1
I ordered this since it looked so cute on the model . when i it arrived, i was excited to try it on, but when i did...blah. the color is murky and the top runs large, not to mention that the material is too heavy for a short sleeved top (plus it's lined). i really wanted to like it and debated wetting it and then putting it in the dryer to shrink it a bit. in the end, i decided that it wasn't worth it. too bad, as the concept was a good one. it just failed in the execution.	0
Bought my 3rd pair of pilcro cords in the dark turquoise. the other 2 are from previous seasons. love these pants for fall because they are extremely comfortable and stylish. the dark turquoise was paired with the poppy tunic (in blue) at my local store. i liked the pairing and ended up buying both! i find these to fit true to size vs other items at retailer that fit larger. i am a 29 (8) while in most other pants at retailer, i am a 6. i am 5'7 and 135 lbs.	1
These capri length pants are awesome!  i do recommend sizing down though as the l was really big on me (i am a 10-12 with most of my weight in my rear so normally never size down in pants)--the fabric is really nice and the print is versatile and allows wonderfully for pattern mixing.  super comfortable!	1
You know how you look in your closet and things just say i'm perfect for today. this top is like that. i got it a few weeks ago and have worn it often because it is so easy and hangs really nice. i bought the black one and am considering the off white one.	1
I love this dress! i generally wear size 10 and the medium fits perfect. i'm a curvy lady and this dress fits great. i've received many compliments on it and might even get another pattern because i love it so much!	1
Possibly my favorite retailer purchase ever! like wearing a cloud & fit perfectly! if you're busty - not sure about it -- but otherwise wow! told my husband: hope you like it because you'll be seeing it all the time & he not only agreed but wanted to know if they made pajamas for men.	1
"After reading the reviews, i had high hopes for this dress but was disappointed that it wasn't flattering on me.  i'm 5'4"", 126 pounds and generally wear a size small, but the small of this dress looked more like a maternity outfit on me. it squeezed the bust a bit too much, and left open some of the areas just under the arms that could probably have used a teensy bit more coverage to be truly flattering."	0
This is a great fun dress! it's very unique and well built. my only complaint is that the colors are not the same in the photo. the real colors are black on top and a bright red with shiny torquoise thread running through it. it's still gorgeous!	1
I was disappointed when i got this romper in the mail. the picture looks much cuter than in person. although it's true to size, it looks pretty baggy on. also, i thought the grey (top) and blue (bottom) were too similarly colored; more contrast would have been nice. i'm returning this item.	0
"This is the second of the new dress batch i have purchased and it is lovely. this catalog shot does not do it justice. the colors are brighter, but not neon, lots of indigo and coral. there is a tad of yellow? the bodice makes my aa size look much ""more."" the bodice fits me perfectly as the top pleating is flat. the v neck is just right - not too low, and the back is even prettier. the dress just fell gracefully out of the package without a wrinkle and without a mussed pleat! that was a sh"	1
I absolutely love this top. it can be worn with shorts or jeans, dressed up or down. it fits perfectly, i am broad on top so i ordered a large. i bought it in white..i wish they had more colors. love it.	1
Bought this shirt on a whim, and it surpassed my expectations. just enough business, just enough pleasure. i wore it with high waisted skinnies and wedges and stopped counting the compliments! excited to try it in other ways. it's summery in print, but fall ish in color, so i think i can get even more use out of it in the next few months.	1
Love this top. it's very comfortable,  and flatters  my midsection. versatile piece.	1
"This dress seems quite high quality and is wonderfully designed, except in the chest. the wrap style hugs in all the right places but the chest. i'm slightly large chested (34c/d) but can usually wear a size small or size 4 in dresses and tops (5'5"", 122 lbs). the small in this dress was great everywhere else, but i couldn't breathe and it totally flattened out my chest. also, it is quite low cut, so another mark against it for anyone with a semi-large bust. couldn't wear it to work that reason"	0
I love this sweater. as others have mentioned, it's not the softest acrylic in the world, but i can overlook that for the simple fact that it's adorable. i like the cropped fit- pairs perfectly with high waisted jeans/skirts. the embroidery has a sort of handmade feel to it without looking cheap. the slit up only one side makes it unique in my opinion. i did expect it to be a bit heavier, but it's a great layering piece and ideal for transitioning into colder weather. i may be biased because of	1
Fit is okay, the style of the shirt and the purple flowers are beautiful!	1
Ordered this online and thought it was more of a red than the true orange that it is	0
I typically wear a medium, but went with a large because i am pregnant and tall. i think i could have used the medium in width, but like the length of the large. it is a wider fit and is significantly shorter in the front than the back, but i think works with the look of the top. i think you could dress it up or down and the fabric is cozy. i would highlight that it has a wider fit, but i think that is the design of the top. overall, i am pleased and i think meets my search for an off the should	1
The pleats on the bib make this look like something from chloe sevigny's wardrobe on the set of big love. and the shoulders are cut for an offensive lineman.	0
I bought this for a wedding i will attend 10 months from now. when i saw this dress on sale, i just need to get it! it was simply gorgeous!!! it fitted so well. it makes one feel so special. i like the addition of the belt.	1
Looked really cute on line. arrived with a large hole in the front! quality and look was very cheap!!! would not recommend this sweater at all. step it up please retailer!	0
"I love this top! from the details on the cuffs to the draping at the neck to the light-weight, yet very high-quality material, this top is my new winter-spring transition piece. i'm 5'3"", small chest, and a slight curve in the hips. the arms of this top fit me fine, but because the fabric doesn't stretch, you may find the sleeves too fitted. the length is perfect for hiding the butt without looking like pajamas (about mid-thigh). i've paired it with cuffed jeans and sneakers (like the model is w"	1
I was so excited to order this sweater. i thought that the moss color would make it a great basic for work or casual days. ordering it on sale made it all the better. however, when it came i was so sad to see how muted the colors were, with little definition. the sweater itself lacks definition as well, just shapeless and hangy. i also did not expect the angora like hair on the sweater which bothered by eyes as soon as i tried it on.	0
"I am pear-shaped and often have a hard time finding pants that fit just right. these did the trick!! they are slim in the waist, but have plenty of room for bigger hips. the overall fit is body skimming/hugging, but they are not tight or uncomfortable in any way! and i have no gapping at the waist. the fabric has a slight sheen to it and a little stretch, but they will be a perfect pant for the office. for reference, i am 5'4"", 34/26/38, and i got a 6 regular."	1
This shirt works for both going out and going to work, and i can wear it with everything. fits perfect, tucked and untucked, tied and untied. i love it.	1
"5""5', 130, 32dd. i saw this dress online and thought it was beautiful, but considered not buying it because of other comments that the bust was too small for women with more curves. fortunately, the lovely blue dress was in my local retailer store and i decided to try it on in a size 4. i think the dress fits perfectly and i have gotten many compliments, including from random strangers. i have had no problem with a tight zipper or a low back, which is perfectly able to cover my bra in the back. th"	1
I purchased the blouse in both the ivory and black. the black i decided to keep because it will go with anything. i was hoping the ivory blouse would work but it's thin and see through. if someone could please tell me where i could find a casual, white or ivory blouse that is not entirely see through i would greatly appreciate it!	0
Although the material of this top is beautiful and the quality is nice as well, it really did not lay right on me. i'm a 34d, and i got my usual size in a small. the arm holes were a bit too big, the waist was too wide and it overall looked like a bib on me.	0
I agree with other reviewers, this print is beautiful, i'd love to see the artists other work... however, the price is steep for sure! i was hoping to wear this with my skinny jeans but it is waaaay too short for that! i have an extra long torso so this is not an unusual problem for me, but this one is worse than usual almost like a crop top. unlike other reviewers tho, i would not want to size up. it fits snugly but not tight. the fabric doesn't give much tho, so if you're on the verge of siz	1
This dress is super comfortable and flattering.  i went with the stripes (and the p to shorten the length) -- it looks amazing with otk boots.  however, the material isn't very thick; it's more of a fall/spring dress than a winter.  i'm a xs-s p in retailer dresses - i went with the small.  xs would've fit but less flatteringly	1
"It was just too big in the regular size and too short in petite.  the proportion was off.  i bought a similar sweater last year in a blue color that i wore constantly and was hoping this would be like it. i think if you are very tall you might pull this off. i'm 5,4"" and even the extra small regular hung below my booty."	0
I loved this t-shirt when i first tried it on: a good cut--not too drapey or fitted. but then i washed it (laid flat to dry) and it shrunk so much that it's unwearable now. so disappointing.	0
These run tiny. i wear a 25/26 in pants and took a medium in this bottom and i'm still not completely comfortable with the fit. love the floral print, but with a bottom this small you don't really see much of the flowers so on mine at least it's just some splashes of different dark colors.	1
The first surprise is that in person, the material is actually kind of woolen? at least, i would definitely call it a winter knit. the colors are also a little different -- so much so that i didn't recognize it in the store. i'm not sure if the one i tried on was stretched out, but it definitely ran large on me. the waistband is elastic, so i would worry about is stretching over time. i would have been curious to see what the petite option looked like on me, as the regular version was longer tha	0
Love everything about it!! chunky, comfortable, lazy day or dress up with a cool necklace!	1
I love the print and style of the skirt. it is very cute and feminine and can easily be worn into autumn. the downside is that the elastic waist is a little too loose and needs to be tighten. also, the is a lot of extra fabric in the skirt and makes it look so much larger than it is and it runs about 3 inches longer. for reference, i'm 5'5, 34 24 35 and the xs is loose in the waist. still, i really love the skirt and plan on keeping it and having it altered.	1
"What a great sweater! the pale pink is sweet but the grey was more my style. i'm 5'5"" 120 (34c) and the xs is perfect. i know everyone is saying this sweater runs large but i believe this style is meant to be a bit oversized, so i would call it true to size with that in mind. the arms are long, the shape is boxy (but not short) and i love the way it hangs on my thin frame. it's super soft & cozy; will easily be a go-to sweater this fall."	1
I love this kimono, it's so soft, very beautiful and delicate. so flowy just like picture... gives your outfit such a beautiful addition!	1
"I think these jeans are much better in person than on the picture. on the model they look a bit boxy and too loose for my taste. i am tall, slim/athletic and they fit like made for me in my usual size. they have some ""give"" and tend to get looser while you wear them, but because they are midrise they won't slide down. they are a slightly relaxed swlim fit on me. the demin is solid, the color a nice medium dark sky blue. the emobroidery and the beads are beautiful and look like they will hold up"	1
I love the print and quality and safari look to me. it does run tight across the shoulders i would size up.	1
I bought my typical size (xs) and it fits perfectly. it's loose but not overly baggy which is what i was looking for. the material seems very durable. my concern with all white tops is being too thin and see through and that was not the case with this shirt. the front comes right above my crotch and the back covers my cushion. i've only worn it once and that was with some bootcut jeans, booties, simple earrings and a statement necklace. i highly recommend it.	1
"I was not sure about ordering this dress, but i'm glad i did! i love the cut and all the details...very unique! i am usually a 10 and the medium fits me perfectly. love, love! if you're on the fence about ordering this dress, i say go for it. for reference, i'm 5' 6"" and the hem hits me mid-calf."	1
"I love the bohemian look and fell in love when i saw this dress when i saw it online. it's pricey but i am holding on to it because it's really beautiful. i got a medium. i'm 5'2"", medium built. it's just perfect. i'm tempted to get the petite but with petite, the top gets to be too short so i think i'll stick with regular size. my family loved it! the quality and detail in the dress is just gorgeous! you can easily dress this up or down."	1
I fell in love with this cute top, however after reading reviews, i am going to return it. seems there is a problem with it shrinking after following washing instructions. who wants to dry clean a tank top? not me, sadly. too bad. style was cute and color was awesome.	0
At first i was taken by the beautiful lacework and the pictures online showing what appeared to be a loose but shaped silhouette. the pictures must have been staged with pins in the back because, in person, the shirt fits like a circus tent. without exaggeration, there is a surplus of about 16 inches. the material is still beautiful. and because of that, i haven't decided whether i'll return this shirt or try cutting out some excess fabric to create a cleaner, more fitted shape.	0
Love to just throw on this shirt with whatever accessories and skinny jeans. easy to wear and very comfortable	1
"Ordered this coat in a small. it is meant to be a slouchy and the fit is perfect - i'm 5'5"" and weigh around 120. the sleeves are slightly longer than 3/4. the fabric is so soft, the coat is unlined and drapes beautifully. this coat reminds me of a coat my mother had when i was a child.... she referred to it as her 'car coat'... i believe that was a style then. worth the $."	1
I have been thinking about getting this dress for a while, but was holding out because i was concerned it would look like a sack! but i am so glad i got it, and so glad my usual size was not available! typically i'm a m or a m petite but i ordered this in a s petite. while still flowy, i think it would have been overwhelming in my usual size. i think it will be great for many occasions as the solid black can be dressed up or down. i can't wait to wear it! definitely consider sizing down.	1
This is too much fabric for me (115 lbs, 30dd, 26.5 in waist, short) even in the smallest size, but i saw another costumer try it on and it was sooo lovely.  the fabric has a shimmery thread, very pretty. the cut was super flattering on her curvier body, it was gorgeous. she tried it on with boots, and also put on a long vest over it every way was beautiful, jsut not on me, sadly. so i say give it a try, may work for you.	1
I bought this dress because it was cute, swinging and lightweight -- seemingly perfect for this hot nyc summer. after on wash and dry, the dress is already ripped around two buttons. i'll still wear it but i don't think it'll last until next summer. kind of pitiful since it wasn't a cheap-o dress. also it is big but that seemed to be sort of the point.	0
This is an adorable top. i purchased both the green and the blue. the colors and look are so much nicer than the photos of it. this is a stock up item.	1
For me to buy a tank top it better be special and this is. flattering without being skintight, it camouflages that little back bacon you sometimes get from a bra. the v-neck is low and is the same in the back. great length, super soft and the best part is you can wear a bra! i haven't washed this yet, but based on other reviews i'll probably hand wash and air dry. the only issue is the tag flops out every now and then.	1
I read the online reviews that the dress ran large so ordered size 6 and 8. i'm normally an 8 or 10, and the 6 fit perfectly. dress hangs beautifully and lining is really soft. appears that it will wrinkle somewhat easily but i am keeping it anyway since it's so beautiful. the bell sleeves are really cute! i highly recommend the dress.	1
Today was my first visit to our new store! the sales person had this on and i liked the medium tones of the colors. many times i hesitate to order because i never know if the brand will run small and this does not. if you wear a medium in michael kors shirts, order medium.	1
This is a deliciously soft and cozy cashmere sweater. the cashmere is thick and knitted with a ribbed brioche stitch. the sweater is true to size, though a bit boxy, so i did size down for a slightly more fitted and flattering look. the sweater is a little on the short side, but i'm petite, so i thought the regular xxs was perfect. the stitch details are lovely and it it so soft i want to wear it every day. it did start to pill after one wear, but this is the nature of cashmere. i'm very pleased	1
5'1'' 43-31-43. i really wanted to love this coat: the material is nice, the green color is dark and rich, it has a hood. however, the cut is bad for me (and probably a lot of other people). the shoulders were cut too wide and impeded movement, and the bust and hips were cut too tight, overall it was just boxy. i have another boiled wool coat that i bought at retailer about 7 years ago and though it's cut oversize like this one, it has a much fuller sweep, so the proportions still seem right. also	0
This was huge on me! otherwise i thought it was a nice top, slimming. i didn't bother looking for another size, though. i got a medium. i wear a small or medium.	1
So comfy, great quality, not see thru at all, has a liner that you cant even tell is there. wish it was a little smaller- got an xxsp but going to keep it anyway, dont need a bra.	1
This is a great skirt to add to your closet. i love it. it is comfortable, soft, and has detail to it. i enjoy wearing it for work or a night out.	1
As in most ribbed camis, this stretches out - so size down. it is very pretty/delicate (e.g. fabric is thin) and the silver/grey color has metalic thread running through. plan to pair it with an retailer grey bolero sweater for the holidays.	1
This dress can be casual, or you can dress it up for going out. i just love this dress!	1
I love the fit of these pants. i bought them in several colors, but unfortunately when i laundered the teal blue pair, the places where the liquid detergent touched them (not bleach, detergent) look like they've touched bleach. i washed them in cold with regular detergent but will be unable to wear them after one wear. i was confused and even checked the detergent to make sure it did not have bleach in it, and it does not. very disappointing and i hope this is not true of the dye in the other co	0
Cute and comfy. looks like i will be able to dress up a bit too. fabric and fit are great!	1
Strange fit if you have a short torso. i ordered a medium petite and the drop waist looked strange, so i tried using a belt and it bunched up. returned the dress. why should a nice simple dress like this create such hard work?!	1
The dress didn't meet my expectations, specifically the color, the texture, and the cut of the dress. although the dress was very well made, it just wasn't right for me.	1
I love, love love this top. i've bought several over the years and they wash great and are very flattering and comfortable. i always pick up the newest color.	1
This dress is exactly what i was looking for. i have a very business casual job but wearing jeans and blouses can get boring so i'm constantly on the lookout for easy, go-to dresses that i can throw on year round with flats, booties, sandals, etc. this dress is exactly what i had in mind and i look forward to wearing it in the fall/spring with booties and in the winter with tights.	1
I really like this top. while it looks somewhat like just a t-shirt, it is not. the fabric is light and soft, it has a great texture feel, it dioes not feel like a regular cotton shirt. the print is lovely. i am very pleased.	1
I am tall and this sweater is a great length. very flattering, slightly loose across the tummy. i have the red/mauve color and may order the gray too. super soft , medium weight sweater- very versatile. love	1
"I tried this dress in store and was in love immediately! i had to special order a petite size, but fits wonderfully. for me, ran a little large. i'm 5'2"" and 105 and ended up with a petite xxs and it fits great!"	1
I got the navy blue pattern and i absolutely love it. it's soft and cozy and just dressy enough to pull an outfit together.  i initially sized up to a 10 based on other reviews but exchanged it for an 8, my normal size. it's flowy so the bigger size was way too much fabric. in the 8 it's just right for the style.	1
I am 5'5. 125 pounds, size 4-ish (sometimes a 4, sometimes a 6), athletic build. these pants fit great except they are pretty large around the waist, about 2 extra inches of space. i don't think the problem would be fixed by sizing down since only the waist was large. i will need to get them tailored.	1
I bought the blue & white one and it is so very comfortable! it will look with my blue jeans and in the summer with my white leggings! great quality at a good price.	1
I personally didn't like it enough to purchase but it is a well made top. in the photos i am wearing a medium and for reference my measurements are 38-30-40.	1
These are great pants, have them in the green holly color	1
Ordered on line and thought these are a great quality as i pulled them out of the box. tried them on and found minimal elastic for the waist. within minutes of wearing, the waist fell down past my hips...glad i was at home. looks cute but will not stay up.	0
I bought this in blue and can't wait to wear it, feels so soft. exactly like the picture.	1
Fabulous dress. i was looking for that one dress that i could spend a little money on and wear to a variety of events, mostly weddings. i received tons of compliments and was very comfortable in it. the hooks on the front of the dress to start to unhook themselves if you don't really clamp down on them, but that was the only issue. i don't know how flattering this would be on shorter ladies, only because it ends right around your knees.	1
I saw this dress in the catalog and immediately ran to the store to purchase. then i realized the dress in the catalog is slightly different, but the small differences is what makes the catalog dress so much more unique and worth the money! look at the top, the stripe colors are different. and the stripes flow different on the skirt part as well. and the dress was short on me and i'm two inches shorter than the model. bummer.	0
"This dress is my personal introduction to talented indian designer, ranna gill. i just love this gorgeous, free- spirited dress! i bought the regular medium for my 5'1"", 34f, size 8 figure. it works very well. i will want to wear a black cami, as i'm not comfortable with some cleavage showing (maybe 3/4"") and the open lines of lacy, small holes down the front and back. you might not mind showing more skin though and not need a cami. the top is not very see-through, and the skirt is lined. the re"	1
These jeans are perfect in every way. i found that i took one size smaller than i do in the pilcro chinos. they are comfortable and have a small amount of stretch to them. i knew i was buying them the instant i put them on. they look great - highly recommend.	1
"I love his cardigan! i knew the small would be a little big since i am normally an xs or xxs. i decided to give it a try anyway. it's definitely a little big - i would have liked an xs to be an option (5'3"" and 110lbs, for reference). i'm keeping it because it still looks cute, just a little loose through the body."	1
Lovely dress!  i&amp;amp;#39;m wearing it with a blue denim jacket and brown suede boots.  it is most certainly purple - a little more so than the picture.  still love it.	1
"I really wish this had fit me so i could keep the vest. beautiful colors and construction. i am 5'9"" with a 36c chest. the medium was quite a bit too small across the chest (i could not close the hook) but it fit perfectly around the hips. i did not want to order a large because i felt the boxy style would be too large around the hips even if the chest fit better."	1
This top is so flowy and has a great fit! i can see wearing it lots of different ways. it could definitely be dressed up or dressed down.	1
This dress is really lovely in person. the fit was perfect and the length not too short. for reference, i'm very busty at 38f and the dress actually fit! (i'm an xl usually, and the fit was tts) the only thing i'm not crazy about is the slip, it's more of a flesh toned color. i'll probably swap it out for a white one please make more like these, retailer!	1
This romper is adorable!!! i love the long sleeves!	1
Trying hard to stay away from tops that are basic tees and branch out with patterns and different cuts. never thought i'd find both in one top. love this! i put it on and knew i had to take it home. it's fitted but not, busy but just enough so, and it's made in the usa! can't go wrong.	1
Quality is fantastic but i feel like a 14 would have barely made it's way around one leg! this pant is way small in terms of sizing and not a style fit for anyone over a 6. a lot of fabric in the legs. nice pant but not for this girl!	0
"This dress has been on retailer's site for a while now (years?) and i finally grabbed one during a recent member sale. i can't believe i waited so long! it's so gorgeous on - classy but still distinctly sexy. i'm 5'10"" 160# and the size 8 fits great - definitely fitted through the hips and thighs and roomy enough on top i considered taking it in. beautiful dress overall!"	1
"I tried this top on in the store today and had to have it! i love the laces up the sides and the zipper in back. it is short - i found a really cute pair of ""baggy"" pants with a black pattern to pair with it. in retailer shirts i wear an xs or s - or a 0 or 2. i got this in a 0 and it fit perfectly."	1
These feel well made and so soft, but for me, they were just too low and too baggy...all i did was pull them up and feel uncomfortable. i wanted them to work! maybe in a smaller size they would feel better. i ordered my normal 25, in the light pink. they were very cute, i think i just have a hard time with pants with a rise this low.	1
I love everything about this tee. it has wonderful detailing that makes it different from other tees. the fabric is soft, and the tee is very comfortable. i disagree with some of the other reviews about the colors. i actually love both colors. the red is a nice slightly brownish red. i wore that color with a pair of plaid (white, teal, & taupe) shorts, and i got compliments on my outfit. the color will go with more than one might think. i haven't worn the green one yet. i hope this tee comes bac	1
This sweater/tunic is very poor quality - the seams looked like they were about to come apart as soon as i got it. and, without a chunky statement necklace, it looks like your grandmothers apron. there just isn't any style to it - has to go back.	0
I saw this jacket in stores, but did not buy it. i went home, but could not get this trendy jacket out of my head. i returned to the store the very next day and purchased this item. i am very pleased with the quality and think that the fit could go well on most body types. i got the denim color, which may not be the best color for all, but i love it because denim is timeless and very versatile. i would suggest this to anyone and could not be happier with this! go out and buy it now, you won't re	1
I haven't worn jeans in a year because i felt uncomfortable and constrained. these are as soft as my leggings. they have so much stretch, you could do yoga in them. if you want the jean look w/o the stiffness/structure, get these. flattering to the booty too.	1
"1. i'm 5'5"" tall, 145 lbs, and 38-32-40 and the pilcro hyphen chinos and stet chinos fit me perfectly, if a bit loose in the size 30. the size 30 in this flare pant was snug in the hips and waist and loose in the thighs and legs. i could not tuck a shirt in. 2. the front pockets with the leather trim are sewn shut. i'm fine with this, as it keeps the pockets aligned properly. however, there are still pockets on the inside incase you want to unpick all the stitching that's keeping the pocket clo"	1
I bought this dress in a sm for a cruise i'm taking soon. i don't have much of a waist, kind of straight like a board, and this dress is very flattering on my figure. the skirt fits snug and the top drapes nicely over my waist. very pretty and flowy. i bought the multi color stripe dress and the vertical stripes enhance the beauty of the dress.	1
At first i wasn't sure about it. the neckline is much lower and wavy than i thought. but after wearing it, it really is comfortable. it stretches a lot, so i wear a cami underneath so when i lean forward i'm not showing the world my torso.	1
This bra is so soft and comfortable i feel like i'm not wearing a bra at all, except i have the gentle support i need. the material is very thin and the pink color is see through, so not recommended under a white or see through shirt. perfect for sleeping or lounging in!	1
Beautiful colors	1
These leggings are soft, comfortable and go with everything. love the way they feel.	1
I love the feel of this shirt. from a distance it looks like flannel but close up it appears more like muslin. i find the fabric very soft and the colors are fab--more vivid than the photo. the buttons do not go all the way up the shirt. for me the top button is right at the top of my cleavage so i can wear it alone or with a cami or other scoop neck. if you want a more refined flannel look/feel, this is it. i find it tts. if you're in between sizes, i would order down.	1
I always chuckle when i see this dress because it looks so busy and so crazy with all the mixed prints, i think it's a lot of fun. not so fun to put on, but it's worth the trouble. i swear my shoulders are sore after manipulating this on myself. i also own the mona dress in 8p, but i had to size down to a 6 for the melodist because the hips were not fitted enough and the back bloused out too much.	1
This pair of flare is just what i have been searching for. the color is a nice vintage blue. i love the fit of the flare however please keep in mind these do run long and larger that size.	1
The jacket is cute, it runs small but looks good. i like it even though it feels tight on my arms.	1
"Great fit! for reference, i am 5'7"", 160 lbs and bought a size medium. there is a piece of fabric that acts as a cami underneath to prevent any unwanted reveal with the lace up. soft fabric and falls beautifully!"	1
I agree with a prior reviewer who stated this seems overpriced - it is. it's very lightweight and not quite the quality i would expect for the price (the washing instructions tag was sewn in all crooked - really?). i ordered the black as i was hoping to wear this to a dressy (though not formal) event but i am not sure it works on me. i think it would be a really fun summer dress option in either of the 2 colors (the blue looks really pretty online). it is very cute but definitely runs large.	1
I wanted to love this dress, it looks beautiful on the model but it isn't the flattering, even on sale i am not sure if it would be worth it, it it runs pretty big.	0
Fit, length and design were perfect. i took this skirt on a recent business trip and it transitioned perfectly from meetings to cocktail with an accessory change.	1
"The detail on the fabric of this blouse is beautiful and unique, especially the peachy/pink and orange detailing which is hard to see in the picture. the fabric and seam are quite delicate though so it just needs to be worn and handled with care. fits true to size. 5'5"", 135lbs, 34c and the small is perfect."	1
I had a feeling this might not work for me, so i decided to try it on in the store just to verify. i was quite right. i'm a tall gal with a size 36c, and it just billowed out and made me look wider. i normally wear a size m in tops and even this was a tad loose. if you're petite/smaller framed, this will probably work for you. if you're tall and busty, this doesn't do us gals any favors, in my opinion. it is a lovely top, and i loved the velvet trim at the bottom, the inner lining was decent,	1
I was very excited about this product. when i saw it the pattern was beautiful in the romantic floral and the bottom band looked like the bathing suit was a little longer so i felt it would be good for a large chest. when i received the package i knew instantly it ran small. i tried it on and it barely covered half of my chest. also the band at the bottom is actually very small and not what i expected. the print is just as lovely in person as it is online. i don't even know if sizing up will mak	0
I so wanted to love the striped peplum top, however i have a petite frame with a large chest and there was absolutely no support in the top. not flattering in the least for a d-dd cup. will be returning. i imagine this would be perfect for someone with a frame like mary kate or ashley olsen :)	0
This skirt has a unique, fun pattern and a fit that is absolutely perfect. just figure flattering without being too tight or revealing. can't wait to wear it for a holiday dinner.	1
"This top is cute. i got the mint coloured one and like it. with that said, the sewing however is a bit off. the bottom of the top is angled. there is no mention of that in the description so it is safe to say it is not part of the design. it is not tremendously noticeable,  but i noticed it. i will still keep this top, coz i can camouflage that defect with a cardigan.  it is sheer, so if you are wearing it for work without cover, a camisole would be required or a nude bra. i am 5'0"", 109lbs, and"	1
I ordered this top in red based on one of the reviews. it is more like marroon. i am very disappointed. the top itself is plain cotton and not that great quality. it is long and has the belt at the back, but the fit and quality overall are very plain. it looks a tad dowdy. i am still keeping it because i got it on sale and i can wear it at home with lounge leggings. but it is definitely not dressy. perhaps white may not look as bad. the plain design and marroon dull color don't help.	0
This is totally different. great addition to my wardrobe!	1
Exactly what i was looking for. cozy, not too warm, fits comfortably and roomy without looking baggy. the print is beautiful. will definitely be buying more sleepwear from retailer!	1
"The fit is gorgeous, but i didn't realize it was completely transparent. when it says ""mesh"" it means ""mesh""! i was thinking the ""mesh"" part was on the bottom. because of how it is cut, high on the shoulders, you can't wear a cami underneath to provide coverage. very cute, but not practical."	0
So stylish. i have gotten tons of compliments on this sweater. i absolutely love it!	1
I love this tee, the fabric is very comfortable and the v-neck is not too deep for petites!	1
This shirt is really quite cute. it can be dressed up or down depending on the occasion. it's also forgiving and quite flattering. my only concern is that it is a bit see through in certain lighting but it is very subtle. i definitely would recommend.	1
"Pros: material is amazing, super soft and quality thickness (but not like uber this, just enough, it will last). also seems like it won't wrinkle much which would make it a great dress to throw in a bag for a trip. fits well in the shoulders, chest and the length is good. cons: the ""waist"" line is really tight and really really high. i'm 5'8"", 150lbs and my usual medium is pretty tight. of course it hits me on the rib cage too, which is so weird. it's way higher than it should be. i'll pro"	1
I was so surprised by this jacket! i grabbed it as a last minute thought and then when i tried it on i was in love! i have a pink dress i'm going to wear it over but i also love it over a frilly off white tank or even just over a basic t. i am so excited for cooler weather. be warned its not lined or warm. its more of a shirt than a true jacket but it's perfect for fall in california. i wear a small or m and went with a medium on this one.	1
I originally bought this dress in the store. however, it ended being a size too big. so, i reordered the smaller size online (although it was backordered for a month). when it arrived, i noticed the sleeves were not cinched (like they are in the picture as well as the original dress i had purchased in-store). i thought maybe it had been a fluke so i returned the dress and reordered it again because it is a great dress. the second one just arrived and the sleeves are not cinched as well. this may	0
I ordered the xxs, i think retailer has gone on the bigger size again and i went from small to xs to xxs... so true to size in that sense. i love the color (nude), and it is pretty soft and comfortable. the cut is flattering, the cowl neck is pretty, the sleeves are shorter, and the hem is wider (aka swing). this would look totally adorable with my flare or wide leg jeans. i think ti would look nice too with skinnies, if you have leaner legs. (for reference, 30dd, 26.5 in waist, 115 lbs)	1
The fabric pattern is darling. i wore it in amsterdam and was told it looks like a traditional folk pattern. the dress is lightweight and is loose at the waist. sometimes i add a belt to cinch it in. like another reviewer said, the buttons do pop off easily. i lost one at the cuff on the first day i wore the dress.	1
Very long shirt, i have to tuck it in. i love the lipstick design and its great quality material. its really soft and cotton breathable.	1
"Fits true to size! looks great just wish it was a tad longer but i am 5'10"" so..."	1
I love the design of this shirt - very flattering fit. very soft and great as a layering piece.	1
Love love love these pants!!! super comfortable and fit true to size.	1
Like most people here, i wanted this beautiful dress to fit. so, i decided to see for myself if maybe, just maybe the negative reviews were wrong. they weren't. if you have any sort of breasts at all, the top probably won't fit properly. i imagine a narrow upper torso, like a 32 or 33, possibly a 34 might find the top part of the dress closes properly, but with a 36 c, i could not get a size 12 to button up. the waist hit at a strange spot, and despite the picture showing a narrow waist and grad	0
My daughter tried on this shirt in new york & loved it so i ordered it for her for christmas1 i am thrilled, & she will be thrilled! love my purchase!	1
I am going to disagree with reviewers who say this runs small. i found it very short and wide. that being said, it is meant to be cropped. i ordered a size small and it fit perfectly, albeit a little short. for reference, i am usually a size 6/medium in retailer shirts and dresses.	1
This dress is beautiful and would make an excellent party dress for winter. it is well made and the details are pretty. however the waist is cut in sort of a scallop shape, so it is higher on the sizes and dips down in the middle over the stomach. i wear a size l or 10 in dresses at retailer, and it just did not flatter my body type at all. for a thinner, narrow silhouette, i suppose it would look better, like it does on the model. i had to return it.	0
I ordered this in size xl. it fits true to size. it does have a boat neckline which runs a little tight on me. but, everything else feels comfortable. i know this isn't a flattering style. horizontal stripes on my plus-sized, pear-shape isn't my favorite. but, i love the back. the knot isn't very comfortable to lean against. i just love the lace in the back that i wear it when running short errands where i don't have to lean back a lot. it does need a tank underneath or it's see-through in the b	1
Agree with the positive reviews. this fits nicely with my casual lifestyle. i ordered an xl in the grey although i generally wear a large. it's a bit oversized with plenty of room for layering. it does bulge a bit in the back but the knit waistband still hits just below my waist. the only drawback is that the sleeves are a bit wide, long and loose at the wrist. it's lined in the body with a soft fleece. the sleeves aren't lined but have a soft silky fabric in the cuffs so easily rolled, adding i	1
I returned the dress because the color was not as pictured in the online photo. i did not like the color.	0
I run between an xs and s in most retailer shirts. i went with the xs in this one and was glad i did. the fit is lovely and flattering. i loved this shirt the second i put it on -- then went to order it in another color.	1
I ordered the orange version in size xl. it fits true to size. the fit on me matches the online photos. it's so comfortable to wear. i love the unique details of it. i've washed & air-dried it too. it retained its size. the color is outstanding. it's such a pretty shade that looks more red online than it does in person. there's more of a darker orange tint to it. i've gotten a lot of use out of this tee. hopefully it'll come back in the fall in more colors.	1
As with most retailer tops, this sweater is boxy and baggy through the middle.  i ordered an xs.  it's a very nice, pretty sweater that i'm going to try in an xxs.  the v-neck does go down rather low so it will need a tank underneath. the lace accents are very delicate and make the sweater look more upscale.  the white is a soft winter white.	1
Fits nicely and made with high-quality material. it definitely makes you look very put together with some nice slacks for work. the scarf is a very nice detail and actually doesn&#39;t look like it is a part of the shirt. love!	1
This is a bit pricey, but i think the akemi and kin quality is worth the price. this photo is quite inadequate to let you see the gorgeous dye color and floral detail. the sleeves are upturned and tacked; the curvy hem is very flattering, and the designer added a small triangle of cloth at the top of the curvy side, just to add to the careful, custom detail. the 60% cotton/40% modal is deliciously soft. the fine detail in cut, fit, artistic design will make this not simple tee a divine pleasure	1
This hoodie is just what i had hoped it would be...it is super soft, comfortably loose, but with the tie bottom hugging the hips and low v-neck - it's just the right amount of sexy. it will be my go-to this fall and winter!	1
True to size on the neckline and arms but extremely large and puffy in the torso. very unflattering cut!	0
This t shirt is huge. i am 5' tall, size xs and i am swimming in this xs. i'm trying a size down. it is meant to be oversized but this is extreme.	1
"I picked up this t-shirt at my local retailer today, immediately drawn to the super cute, colorful graphics, and the unique stitching at the collar, saying ""giddy up!"" to go with the cowboys, horses, cacti, and movie camera, (unusually!). the graphics are way cuter in person, as compared to the weirdly wavy-distorted and unclear photos shown online. if all i had seen was these photos, i would never have even noticed or recognized the design. go to your local store to see this in person, and you wi"	1
This dress is perfection! great, quality fabric. bright vibrant color. the design and texture allow it to be dressed up or dressed down. i sized up a size because my normal wasn't available and it fits perfectly!	1
I wanted to love this skirt but i got it today and i just was a little disappointed...i read all the reviews but i found it ran small and really fitted not straight pencil like on the model! it is a knit...and it looked like cotton...has a lot of give but it hangs a little weird. the panel in the front doesn't lie flat and looks a little funky! the colors in the skirt look exactly like the picture on line so that was good... i liked it but didn't love it and for $98.00 i want to love it! i am be	1
Very soft and comfortable. the shirt has an unusual, asymmetrical seam that appears along the front, right-hand side of the garment. (the model is positioned so that you can't see this detail from the picture. i attached a picture that includes the front seam.) i actually like the seam - it creates more visual interest, and adds a little bit of ruching that helps hide my belly. the cowl neck is very well done - there are two layers that form the cowl, and i've found that it means wardrobe malfun	1
I wanted to love this top but couldn't. i am curvy (36/27/39; 32dd) and this accentuated my hips (which is not needed) and made my chest/whole shape seem boxy. i could only recommend this top to someone who is smaller chested with a straight build- the bottom would help give some shape; pleating on front would help chest seem larger. i did love the color and construction, lace details, 3/4 sleeves.	1
Although i love retailer, this product isn't the quality or presentation i expect from them. the dress arrived stuffed into a small plastic bag and was a crumpled mess. the fabric wasn't soft and fluid as i expected, but rather was stiff and a little scratchy. i purchased the ecru version, which was also slightly darker than the photo showed. i returned the dress and will keep looking.	0
After reviewing the comments for this dress i was really hesitant about buying it online, so i finally went to the store and all of the reviews are 100% true. this dress is amazing in terms of quality, but the sizing makes zero sense. i'm normally a size 12, but based on the reviews i initially tried on a medium. even that was huge, arm holes so long you could see my entire bra. so i tried on the small and that fit perfectly. unfortunately, unless you're normally an 8(maybe) or above in sizing,	1
Can't wait for the weather to cool so i can wear this! the split back makes it very flattering.  the 'green' is definitely more brown.	1
"These are my saucy, fun jeans.  when the ps brought them over, i wasn't sure about them but at 5'3, they make the perfect ankle jean.  they look great with boots and are so comfy!  i typically wear a 26-27 but i sized down in these because they're a lower fit on me and i wanted the waist to be tight.  as the darling fiance says, they make your derriere look ""great!""  i'd snag these on sale ;)"	1
I loved the way it looks on. fit tts. only problem for me was it was so itchy. there is that small amt. of wool in it. if you have any problem with wool this may not work for you	0
I love the cold shoulder trend! this sweater is not bulky, but the thick knit will keep you warm while looking stylish! it is not your typical sweater. if you want something unique, but still basic, this is your sweater. looks great with jeans and khakis.	1
This top is very nice heavier weight linen. i normally wear a small or size 6 in retailer but this seemed a bit on the larger size than normal. it's still great quality and i'll probably keep it. a great item to wear for a long time!	1
I was excited to get this romper, but it just didn't work. i'm petite with a large bust and the blousy design of the top portion just hung like a bag on me. returned.	0
Love love! beautiful, soft, great color! very comfortable!	1
A gorgeous and vibrant print! love the ruffles on the bottom and the detailing of the straps in the back. perfect for a beach day!	1
"I am 5""7"" and weigh 123 lbs. i tried on both these dresses in medium, and they both fit. they are not too thin, not too high slit, not scratchy. the problem is i am middle aged with a thick waist. the waist looked lumpy with the close fit knit. if you are younger, slim and tall, you will love it. i sent it back with regrets. hope this helps."	1
I thought this dress was very cute on the model, however it was way too tight across the chest for me. going up a size would mean it would be too roomy everywhere else. also, fabric wasn't great.	0
This dress is great! it fits true to size and the pockets are very unnoticable! my only note is that the first picture of the dress show the dress to be a bit darker than the actual dress. the dress colour more closely resembles that of the other two photos.	1
First off, let me say that i am 52 and don't often go for print jeans these days:) however, these are just so stinking fun and flattering that i couldn't say no. these look great cuffed for warmer temps, and rolled to full length will be fun to wear with fall sweaters. if you are looking for something fun and flattering, these are the ticket! i bought the grey version and feel that they will work with many pieces that i already have.	1
Ordered my regular size 27. they were tight when they arrived but they stretch - a lot. i like the looser style so was vey pleased but think they are at least a size larger after one wear.	1
I've been stalking this suit online for months and i saw it in store yesterday. i never knew what size to order because of the australian sizing. i went with my pants size (8) and it looks great. i carry my weight in my butt and thighs and the boy legs are flattering! i found the size up (10) was loose in the bust for me. go for it, it's the cutest suit ever.	1
"This is a great dress! it's cut nicely, is flattering, and it's not too short. if i put it on, i look put together in a matter of seconds. the dress fits true to size. one thing, i would agree with the other review that this is not really ""tweed."" instead it is made out of a patterned stretchy material that is a little thinner than tweed. the colors are really beautiful, and while the blues and reds are more intense in real life, it looks terrific."	1
Mom loves these and she looks great going to the gym! the cut-outs are so cute!	1
I threw this into my cart online on a whim, but i'm not disappointed! and i don't even wear rompers usually. for reference, i'm 5'2 and normally a size 2, and i bought this romper in a size xs petite. if you're on the shorter side, i definitely recommend buying it in the petite size, as i feel that this romper would run large in the regular sizes. the fabric of the top drapes nicely on me, and the shorts are about medium length. i like the neckline details. the armholes in the petite size aren't	1
It's hard to find a comfortable, attractive tee. this one is it for me. ordered a large. it skims perfectly over my back and lower half. no grabbing. sleeves are cut nicely for those of us who don't love their upper arms. the lacing adds nice detail and interest. it's soft and comfy. it's an unusual color that will go with almost any bottom. great now and under a jean jacket or cardigan as the weather cools.	1
"This is a beautiful, flattering dress, however i can't decide whether to keep it or not! as a few other reviewers has mentioned, the transition between the ""top"" and the ""skirt"" is a bit off - it's like there is some extra fabric there, and the weight of the skirt pulls it down, making it a little awkward/bunchy. i thought it may have been showing up because i am larger chested (36d), but you can kind of see this on the teal dress image, under the chest where there is an extra fold. i ordered th"	1
I'm 5'0 and 114 pounds and got the small petite. i have broad shoulders and am slim hipped. i no longer have a waistline, thanks to having given birth, but this dress really hid that. it gave me a figure! the ruching is super flattering and the material has enough support (with stretch!) to hide any unsightly rolls. so why did i return it? i did, after all, get many compliments from females while trying it on. they loved the color on my pale olive complexion (i'm filipino with -ahem- blond hair	1
I usually wear petite which this was not so a little big for me. but nice color and good quality, but pricey for what it is. it's more like a $45 sweater not $100+	1
Even though i had to return this top because it did not fit me properly, it's a very nicely made and attractive piece with a lot of versatility.	1
Perfect for a hot day and skins the body beautifully. so soft! i am usually a medium but got a small which fit perfect. usually swing dresses do not compliment the waistline but this one did!	1
This dress is way prettier in person than online. fits like a glove. a little tight up top as are most side zips. i did not have to size up, however.	1
I live in hawaii and always looking for a comfortable light and breezy dresses, this was perfect. the colors are gorgeous, the fit is true to size and it is extremely comfortable. dress it up or dress it down with a denim jacket and you will be definitely love it. i am thrilled i made the purchase!!	1
I like this top a lot, and have always liked knotted looks around the bust area. i do not have a large chest, and this kind of top always draws attention in all the right places. i was worried the cut would be too low for my comfort level-and it is low but the shirt does not come away from my body in normal movements so i do feel completely comfortable wearing this without a cami underneath. i don't prefer this in black because i think the color detracts from the bunches of fabric created by the	1
It feels soft and like a good quality. however it really does run large and long. i was looking for a loose tank but this one was almost a tunic on my short height and even with a cardigan to give it a shape didn't work out. i also thought it would shrink in the dryer but it didn't. also wrinkles easily.	0
"I love this little chemise! the adjustable straps sold me because i'm petite. i generally wear a small/27p. i'm about 5'1"", 124 lbs. i purchased a small and it fit perfect! the fabric is nice, not too thin or too thick. i would totally wear it just as easily as a nightgown or beach coverup. i've never been able to wear scrappy dresses, but it could probably pass for one of those too. it's flattering and pretty without being too ""pretty"", if you get my meaning."	1
I bought this in the olive green and blue a while ago, both in the small. great jumpsuit and true to size. i accidentally washed the blue one in the washing machine (in cold) but caught it before the dryer. it still fits, although it seems a bit shorter in the legs.	1
Here's an example of lowering a hemline and slapping the term 'petite' on it. too much fabric, was bulky, and ran too small. the fabric was thin and pulled awkwardly over the bust. returned..	0
While you can't count on the photo on your monitor to portray the exact color of an item, these photos are way off.  instead of the warm charcoal i see online, the pants are more of a dusty blue.  the material has very little stretch and i couldn't get into the size 24s.  the 25s were tight in the entire leg but huge in the waist.  for reference i usually wear a size 24 in brands like 7 for all mankind and citizens of humanity.	0
Ordered this in my typical size, xs, and it fits perfectly. the weather hasn?t cooled off enough for me to wear it on a daily basis, but after just trying it on i can say that it fits really nice. the sleeves are a knit material which make them very forgiving and the jacket easy to wear. plus, there is enough room for me to wear a tee-shirt or thin blouse underneath. ordered the slate color and it is a very beautiful neutral, brown that should go with almost anything.	1
This is more beautiful in person. i love the detail and color. i usually don't like ponchos but this one's shape with the square front definitely sets this apart.	1
Love the dress. it's beautiful and flowy and makes you feel like a princess when you wear it. also very versatile, as it can be worn in multiple seasons and dressed up or dressed down. love everything about the dress and know that it will become a staple in my closet. runs true to size- xs = 0/2 and s = 2/4. if you are short, be prepared to have the hem taken up.  worth the buy!	1
Love this dress. fits true to size!! can be dressed up or down. very flattering1 prettier in person	1
Very cute flowy fit. i am generally a size small, 32-d chest. because the material has no give it fits perfectly (just barely) if it was any smaller or i was any larger it would be too small. very cute design.	1
I love this dress and will be purchasing it in other patterns. the fit is incredibly flattering and the fabric is lovely. doesn't wrinkle, easy to wash and wear. i am 5'7, 190lbs, bottom heavy with a 38c bra size. i purchased the size large and it fits me perfectly (though perhaps a little bit snug in the waist). if i wanted a looser fit, an xl would probably work though might be a bit loose on the top. the low back hits just above my bra strap, but does in fact cover all straps. for reference,	1
I&#39;ve been looking for comfortable pants that i could wear to work and at home.  these fit the bill.  i bought these in the holly color for the fall and winter.  they are super soft and very comfortable.  i was worried that they would like dumpy, especially around the seat area, but they fit fine.	1
"I am 5'7"" and 36a cup. i tried on the small and it fits perfectly. i can see how if i was bustier it could be a problem. it looks better in person, dressy enough for the office but comfortable fabric and nicely shaped. i love this with jeans and can't wait to wear it to work!"	1
Super cute!! will be buying another color of this tee.	1
Love this top, you can really fess up, i ordered in a small i am 5 7 and 154 pounds	1
This sweater is huge! i usually wear a small, ordered an extra small and i was still swimming in it. i like big sweaters, but i ended up returning it because the sizing looked ridiculous.	0
"I ordered the copper in a medium which i felt was tts (5'4"" 145). the color is beautiful and i love the buttons on the shoulders which i really didn't notice in the picture, the material is also very soft. but i have some complaints.. first i felt that the material, while soft, was not very substantial for the price. i purchased another vest from that store that has everything which was $100 less and seems to be the same quality. i also was expecting there to be some way to close the vest beside"	1
It's a perfectly cute simple summer dress, but the only reason i'm even considering keeping it is because it was a gift. the material is fine but for this price, i expect something more exciting than what is, really, just a modified t-shirt dress. at least more exciting colors or a print or something. the top piece is 2 full layers which could get warm in the summer, and the ribbing is tight enough that you have to wear a bra even if you're small-chested (i'm a 32b and super thin and still neede	0
I ordered this to go over a dress. i wanted the jacket short, to not cover the waist of the dress. on sale, i think it is a great bargain. the sleeves are long on me, but i rolled them, which i thought was intended since they are lined. the medium fit me. i am usually an 8 in tops. the ivory color is almost a pure white.	1
"I had my eye on this dress since it fist came out, but hesitated to order due to some of the lower reviews. when i got a chance to try it on - i loved it! i did go up a size. i am 5'5"" so i had it shortened to above the knee, i didn't mind losing the unfinished hem - had the hem match that of the pockets. i am a 34c but the bodice is stable and even if i pull at it, it stays put! so happy to find this, especially on sale! i plan to wear it at our company party which is help on a large charter bo"	1
I loved this skirt. they didn't have my size anymore so i tried on a few others. i really needed a small p. otherwise i totally would have kept it!	1
Like other reviewers, i'm glad i sized down. this is a cute tunic that is definitely great quality, lightweight chambray. i love that it has pockets, but they do puff a bit at my hips.	1
These are so comfy! mom of two boys on the go! great for running around and then can be dressed up for a night out on the town! not mom jeans!	1
"Cute swing tee! fit for me is perfect. i am 5'5"" and 140 lbs and i bought my usual small. length is nice. fits me just at my hips. i can wear to work and on the weekends. a little concerned  the fabric may pill so i'm taking extra care. receive compliments every time i wear either color. love."	1
I love this sweater coat. i just put on a pair of leggings and boots and i'm good to go. it's warm and flattering and comfortable and i can wear it anywhere, it works at the office, out to eat, shopping or even just hanging around. fit: some of the other comments mention the small waist. this is a fitted sweater, not a roomy piece for layering over other pieces. i like the fit because i get the warmth of a big sweater without the bulk. the fit is similar to dresses that i have purchased at anth	1
Love it! as a previous reviewer stated, you can actually wear it reversible. so happy i purchased it!	1
This is a beautiful shirt. the back is a few inches longer than the front which makes for a cool effect. the only thing that i didn't like about this shirt was how fragile the buttons on the back are. i was taking this shirt off and one popped off. when i went to hang it, another one popped off! so i had to return it. such a shame.	0
"I ordered this piece online and returned it at the store a few days after arrival. the material is very soft and well made. however it is not flattering on the hourglass or pear shaped person. moreover, if you are short, the design may make you look shorter. i am 5'4"" and it did to me. the design is beautiful. if you are tall and have narrow hips, this is the piece for you. i am 5'4"", 160lbs and usually wear a s/m."	1
I usually follow the boho look, and this dress appealed to me immediately and it was in the color i wanted black. so excited to receive this as i knew i could wear it both as a dress and a tunic but that was not to be. the outfit consists of 2 elements: a tight fitting slip that fits awkwardly and does not give enough room in the bust nor waist areas, and an overlay dress that is really quite pretty. but it too was too tight across the bust area which made the entire upper torso ill fitting. i n	0
Beautiful flowing feminine dress. runs large; size down. hot pink color. well made.	1
"This was sold out in an xs when i first saw the email. i ended up seeing in my local retailer store and tried on my usual xs. i am 5'3"" with a longer torso and about 108 pounds. my chest size is 32c and the xs was just too tight. it buttoned up beautifully and the length was as it is on the model, even though i am much shorter. however, when i tried to move my arms, the jacket constricted all movement. this is a huge disappointment and i imagine going to be an issue for many girls who order online"	1
Very flattering and looks much better on than on the mannequin in store. i an in between small/medium and went with medium which was looser in back and did not show any lumps or bumps. great with jeans, pencil skirts and capris .	1
Got this shirt in the green color. it's long and flowy and fits true to size. super comfy.	1
And this one proved to be no different. the short end of it; this dress is pretty much super thick, heavy linen with a rope like collar (the supposed embroidery you see), and there is no lining, but completely unnecessary pockets. i'm typically a 2 or 4 depending on the designer (5'7 & a super fit 135 lbs) and knew enough to order an xs in this, however it still fit like a potato sack. even upon taking it out of the plastic bag, i knew it was going back. between the unrealistic pictures and lack	0
I love the color and textures of this jacket. the shawl color adds interest while being cozy and fun. wish it ran a tad longer. otherwise a great mix and match piece.	1
This jacket is so pretty and fits amazing! i ordered the size small and it fits as expected. i normally wear a size small and a size 4.	1
"This dress is even more gorgeous in person! i had seen in the spring catalog but liked it even more when i spotted it at my local store. i have been searching for the perfect ivory crochet or lace dress each summer for the past few years. i think i have finally found ""the one'! i should note i am 5'9"" and this dress goes all the way to my knees. it may swallow someone on the shorter side."	1
"The simple shape of this silky & comfortable shift is transported by the fun psychedelic pattern. the fabric is lightweight and drapes very nicely because of the lining. i purchased the size 10 petite to accommodate my 36dd bust/wide rib cage and it fits perfectly. the high neck is fastened with a single hook. versatile and comfortable and a clear winner for spring and summer. for sizing reference my other stats are 5'3"" tall, 140#, m/l on top, s/m on bottom."	1
This caught my eye and i tried it on the in the store today (the green). i found it to run a little bit large - i expected the small to fit, but the xs fit me better (better fit in armholes and also less billowy). i really like the way it looks, but ulitimately did not purchase it today. i might reconsider on sale. the flaws (in my opinion) are that it is dry clean only, the skirt is not lined (and should be), and it's a bit overpriced for the quality. but on the other hand, it's very cute and f	1
I would suggest trying this on in store. the xs would've worked (that's my normal size), but i ended up preferring the s. it does have low armholes. the s in the yellow was just right for me, but the s in the navy was too low in the armholes and the shirt was cut a little crooked. still, a very cute and classic top that i know i'll get a lot of use out of.	1
I had to return this blouse because it ended up been too small and super itchy. im kind of busty but medium usually works and this one was super tight across my chest. not comfortable at all and the fabric is kind of a sheer with the sparkly lines in silver. wouldn't recommend it.	0
Beautiful. elegant. sexy. i love the fit. can be dressed up or wear with jeans. it's great!	1
I read the other review that said the shirt was boxy, i didn't think it would be a terribly big deal. unfortunately, it is. normally i wear a size s, so i sized down o an xs. the shirt fits in the sleeves and neckline, but the shirt is still very box and now super short. unfortunately, this is going back. not a good fit. adorable details but the fit is terrible.	0
I ordered this top in ivory in 2 sizes, because i'm in between and it looks so great in the photos and didn't want to risk it selling out while i debated sizing. i really loved the larger size because the material is not stretchy and i didn't want the sleeves to be tight when i move. it is somewhat boxy on the seam at the waist so i'm having it taken in a little so it fits more like a peplum and flares. adding a skinny belt just didn't distribute the excess fabric as i envisioned. it really is a	1
This cardigan is just the right length, i.e. not too long as so many are these days. but the sleeves are ridiculously long. will have to shorten them for sure. fabric is definitely not heavy. pretty color. i do like it overall..	1
This top is so much prettier in real life than it is on the model. the pattern and texture are both lovely, and the peplum is surprisingly flattering. it is definitely on the short side, but i think that gives it a modern look. the fabric does not stretch at all, but i still think it fits tts. if you have a very large chest you may want to go up a size, but otherwise i would order your normal size.	1
I love these leggings! the material is a bit thicker than your typical leggings material so it hugs without being too clingy like spandex. the fit i's somewhere between leggings and skinny pants. the suede fabric feels soft and looks to be of good quality. the petite fit works perfectly for me as well, no bunching at the ankles. i can see these being a staple in the upcoming months.	0
Bought the camel color and love it. nice for cool evenings and mornings spring through fall. soft and comfortable. delicate yet not too much so that you wouldn't wear often.	1
I'm in between a medium and a large and i ended up with a large because of the sleeves, which are fitted. the sleeve looks loose on the model, but i have some muscle on my bones. the v-neck is a little low and i will probably war a cami underneath, something i would have done in a medium as well. overall i like the top, i got the green. it has a nice style and will stand alone in warmer months without a jacket or sweater over it.	1
My hips are very narrow and i don't have much of a waistline. in a-line skirts and anything that sits below the waist, i wear a size 6. skirts like this with a defined waist almost never work for me because of the waistline. if this is typically your style of skirt, i think it will run large because the waistline is more generous than usual.   i tried it on in the store today and bought it in a size 8. it's very comfortable and cute and will be easy to pair with different things.	1
Loved this online and even better in person. inner lining is like a cozy sweatshirt!	1
This dress is a work of art both online and in person. the color is more vibrant in person and both colors are beautiful. i like the mango color better because it looks better on my olive skin tone, plus i like the purple flowers against the orange background. thank goodness for the liner because this dress is very thin. it wrinkles easily but i think it comes with the territory due to the thin silk fabric. for short gals like me, a belt is a must for a structured look if worn with heels; otherw	1
I wanted to love this top- the pink color is wonderful and vibrant. however, like many tops lately, it is short waisted and ended up looking a bit boxy. i am 5'8 and found it about 1-2 inches too short.	0
These jeans run true to size, very comfy and i love the frayed bottoms	1
This sweater is amazing. color is vibrant. quality is high. but i have a super long torso and it fell short on me. if you are shorter this will be amazing. sad to send it back.	1
For me this had too much material and was a little too tent like. a beautiful dress but not my style. i prefer more a line with not so much material.if you are looking for something roomy this is a good choice.	0
I am 135 and went with a size zero. it was very cute on but a little tight on my hips when sitting. the fabric is beautiful, and very soft and silky. the length was great, comes to just barely above my knees and is long in the back. great work outfit.	1
Very unique, cute top. i had to order up a size as i thought it ran a little on the small size.	1
I've owned a number of pilcro denim jackets it in my day. not because they've ever needed to be replaced, but because i'm obsessed with the fit, the color and the style. when i saw this one i knew it would be no exception! this jacket is even cooler looking in person. the fade on the denim is totally perfect. not too dark, not too light...and not so distressed that it looks sloppy. the denim is soft just like all other pilcro, and the fit is a dream. what i love the most is the interest in the c	1
Perfect fit shirt. super cute and very comfortable. i purchased a size xl at first but it was too large, l fit perfect. i'm normally a size 14 on top, but this runs large.	1
I absolutely love this sweater. it is a beautiful deep blue color. i love the unique cuff on the sleeves.. i feel it does run a bit big but once you pull the strings it shortens up dramatically. looking forward to late summer and early fall so i can wear it!	1
I am a collector of clothes and textiles. that is a passion. this blouse meets all the criteria of something treasured from times past. the roses are almost charles rennie macintosh. i am so happy to own this blouse! it fits perfectly and makes me feel beautiful, stylish in my own style.	1
The arm holes are just weird .. a little too big for me was just 'off'... back it goes.	0
I absolutely adore this dress. i took my time buying it and when i was ready to purchase they were sold out of my normal size 6 but the 8 was still available, so i snagged it. i'm glad because the dress runs small and the size 6 would have been snug around the waist. the style is perfect and the dress is well made. the material is a heavier cotton and the white banding accents it perfectly. i don't think it's too white, like some reviewers have stated. you can't wear a bra with this dress, but t	1
I wanted to love this, but instead of being a flowy kimono top as pictured- it was a thick blazer type garment. not at all what is pictured here unfortunately. also it was much shorter than pictured and i am only 5'4''.  love most retailer styles, but this one was a miss and a return.	0
Bummer, i loved the lacy bell arms and everything about the look of this sweater but it is huge in the abdomen. seriously looks maternity to me. the neck is also too wide. the quality of the material is very nice and the weight is nice and heavy but the cut just didn't work on me. i returned this one.	0
It's the perfect sweatshirt! super comfortable, but also cute! i am 5'4'' and 125 pounds, and the size 0 fits perfectly.	1
I ordered a large and it was skin tight, if that's the look you're going for..	1
Get this one during the 20% sale. if you dry clean it, you will have it forever!	1
"This sweater is beautiful but runs big. i got the xs (5'3"", 110lbs) and it's very roomy. i love the thickness, the color, the pockets, and even the roominess except for the sleeves. they are very long and very wide, which makes it look bulky. if sleeves were slimmer it would look like a cute intentionally oversized style- instead i look like a kid who borrowed a giant sweater. i think it would work better on a taller, slim person. but i still like it."	1
Love this top. makes me look slimmer, comfortable as well	1
This is a beautiful dress. the lace top is stunning! the fit is true to size, and there's no stretch. i had the same problem as other reviewers... that darn zipper. it's so small and gets hung up easily. i could see it eventually failing in the future.	1
This dress is really lovely. it looks so fragile online but in person is rather structured and substantial. it runs very large i just returned mine for 2 sizes down. i also like the zipper up the back so that the eye hooks on the front are not necessary to use to put on. the interior lining is affixed so there is no slipping like a typical under slip. if you are on the fence at least try it. i am glad i did.	1
I passed over this dress online thinking i'd never wear it. but, then i found myself inside an retailer store and decided to try it on. i am excited to say that i love this dress. it is soft and lovely. the cowl is large and the whole dress has a really great drape. my favorite thing is that the buttons along the back are functional. opening up the back turns this dress into a long cardigan that is to die for.	1
"Whoa! these are very high-waisted. but i think i like it! this is a very 70s style with the high waist and wide legs. the brown motif is kinda funky! i am a 70s/vintage lover though, so i was pleasantly surprised. the tall length is more than adequately long for my 6'2"" frame. i may need to take them up a little bit, in fact."	1
"This dress is made of nice thick stretchy fabric. comfortable on, but fairly tight and body hugging. i liked the fabric, but it was the length that got me. i tired on a 6 - i'm 5'6"" and this dress was just at that awkward length. made me look short and stunted. not a wow piece."	0
Great jeans by pilcro, too short and snug around my knees for keeping though.	1
The skirt is just okay. the design is great but the material is extremely thin and see through. there is a slip which goes to mid-thigh- very strange and felt weird as well. the pleats are okay but not great. overall, it is not worth paying full price for or anywhere near that. and again, be wary of it being see through.	0
This top is beautiful in color and fabric. unfortunately just didn't work in the breast line. gapped and there was just nothing i could do to make it hang correctly. i'm not really large in the chest area (38b) but the large just didn't work. had to send it back.	1
This dress is very flattering and well made. i can hardly wait to wear it. it's one of my favorite retailer purchases.	1
This top is absolutely gorgeous, but i followed the care tag to a t and it completely fell apart in the wash. will be returning.	0
This dress is well made and of good quality it just looked a little too old on me. the skirt was heavy and the fabric was cozy, perfect for a fall outfit.	0
I love this top!! in fact if it came in more colors, i'd buy a few more. it's just so soft and comfortable, wear it now in cooler weather with layers or later in spring and even cooler summer nights. the neckline is perfect, love the subtle details. it fits perfect in my usual size medium and is a good length to wear either with jeans or long enough for leggings with a cami peaking out beneath. yes, i love it, just wish there were more colors.	1
Not tissue thin like most tees and easily can be dressed up to wear to work in a casual setting. i find myself reaching for this tee weekly! have every color! i usually avoid stripes however this tee seems to flatter and slim! love!	1
Very cute skort that fits tts. great length for us middle aged women as well! love the hidden front pockets and the modern color block design. my only issue is the side zipper gets stuck right where the waistband starts. i'm assuming this is because of the thicker fabric around the waistband. i usually try to wait for the sale prices, but i think this skort will sell out well before then.	1
"I finally ordered this at this incredible mark downed price...but i see why. it is cute, but serious size issues, i have a bust but smaller everywhere else but i did order up because of it being a jumpsuit...i would have needed 6"" more to even zip the top part! i have many trendy jumpsuits in my closet and this is a first! if you are flat chested you may want to try at this great price as it would be a great piece for sitting by the fireside next fall/winter...never too soon to plan ahead!"	0
Good job retailer for getting the color representation spot on! the blue is so vibrant and the cashmere knit is so soft and comfortable. the dress is oversized but a little too much so. i recommend sizing down to get that ideal slouchy drape, otherwise you may overwhelm your frame with too much fabric.	1
This sweater is absolutely adorable! i was worried about the layers looking too frumpy but they were not - i normally wear a size medlum (8), but i sized down on this sweater on a gut feeling and bought a small --i didn't want it to be too loose or billowy, and it fits perfectly. will be so cute with jeans but also with skirts for work! you will be so happy you bought this one.	1
I like this raincoat but it runs large. exchanging for a smaller size.	1
Perfect crop jeans with just a tiny flare. i'm a size 8 and the 29s fit perfectly.	1
I bought this shirt because the reviews convinced me to. i bought it in the blue color and it's really cute. the design on the sleeves is also great and the back of the shirt looks cute too!	1
Tried this on in store. was ill-fitting and sheer.	0
This hoodie is really cute-i got the polka dot color and it is very soft and roomy. i am normally a small but got the medium and it fits exactly how i wanted. however-it is not a pullover and instead zips up. so odd that the pic of the hoodie is a pullover. debated returning because i wanted a pullover, but have decided to keep it because of how soft it is.	1
I just received this dress in the blue and its very small in the ribcage/bust area. i'm 120 lbs, 5'1, 34d bust and i'm always a 2-4 regular or a 4-6 petite in this brand. i couldn't even zip up the 4 regular all the way. i will probably reorder it in a 6 and an 8. great material, beautiful color, great style.	1
This sweater is super soft and comfortable. runs very big. i usually wear a large, i purchased a medium and it is almost too big.	1
Im normally an xs and i bought size 2 and it fit great. very slimming and looks great with white capris.	1
This is my favorite dress i have ever purchased. as a 6' tall woman, it's hard to find flattering dresses that are long enough for my legs. this dress is classic, comfortable, and truly flattering. i love the blush color and did not have the issues that other people listed for the color being see-through. i can't get enough of this style...i'll be buying it in black too...ooopss :)	1
Love this shirt, great fabric and fit. trying to wait for a sale to buy several others in additional colors.	1
I loved this shirt from the moment i saw it on the table. i am always too tall for a peplum blouse because they hit my rib cage instead of my waist, but this shirt doesn't have that problem! i have the white one, the polka dots are a really pretty corn flower blue color. i usually wear an 8 in maeve blouses, but this one i took a 6. there is definately no give though. i have a very flat chest and only wear a lacy bralette under this shirt because there is no room for anything else. i am sad thou	1
I knew i wanted this top the moment i saw it, so onto my wishlist it went until it went on sale! it fits beautifully in my normal size and i love that it already has a coordinating tank top. i get compliments whenever i wear it- think hd in paris might be my new go-to!	1
Just got this top in the mail today, and i love it. i bought the white in a small, and it fits as pictured on the model. the fabric says it's cotton, but it's a substantial fabric and feels as soft as silk. the bodice is lined, so no bra lines show through. the tiered part of the tank is not lined but is not really sheer or see-through. the arm holes are not too large, as sometimes happens on me when i wear sleeveless tops. i think i'll be wearing this one a lot this summer, and a lot of summers	1
I ordered this online, and was pleasantly surprised when i received it. i'm about 5'5 and 140 lbs and the small fit perfectly. it is very flattering, and i can't wait to wear it!	1
"This is a full swing top. because the top is so full, it should hit at or slightly above the waist (and it does on me) so that a pant or skirt waistline can be seen and balance out the proportions. will look great with a pencil skirt or any pant that as a mid or high rise fitted waist and flat front (no pleats or draw string, for example). the fabric has weight and hangs nicely. color is true to photos. easy way to look a little dressier during summer. 5'3"" 120lb 34b - small regular fit me perfe"	1
I've ordered a pair of these from the catalog and loved them. on my next visit to a store, i picked up another color. i'm now considering getting another pair while the free shipping deal is going on. they are great pants with a great fit.	1
I just scoured the other reviews to see if anyone mentioned this, so maybe i got a defected item, but on my size 6 dress (eagerly awaited), there is a big bulge on the upper back. my husband suggested it was designed for a hunchback - that's really the only explanation. the back seems tall in general, like 2-3 inches above a normal neckline. i tried pulling it down a bit, spreading my shoulders out, folding the top over - all with minimal results. i have a size 4 coming too (20% off discount arr	1
I bought this originally for my daughter but fell in love with it when i tried it on and kept it for myself! it is a cotton/polyester blend so it is very comfortable to wear. the length fits nice as well. i have received so many compliments wearing it with dress pants and also with jeans! thank you for making an item that is both pretty, flexible, and meets the needs of young women (and their moms!)	1
I received this top and loved the pattern. however, i ordered both and s and m, and the bust sizing on this top is very odd. i am a 34c, and the bust area was way too big on both, but if i had sized down to the xs the rest of the suit would be too small. maybe it's just made for busty people? also the supportive material in the bust area goes straight across kind of like a bandeau, so that added to the odd look of the bust. it's still a beautiful pattern, so if you're going to give it a try orde	0
"Love this skirt because of the colors, the unique style, and for a knit skirt i'm very impressed that it maintains shape throughout the day. great skirt to own. received several compliments. had to size up from a 2 to a 4. 28"" waist and 36"" hips. the size 2fit snugly and not very appropriate for work, but great for a night out. the size 4 is still form fitting, flattering and work appropriate. very comfortable going up a size without compromising the form fit."	1
Like other reviewers have mentioned, i was hesitant to spend so much money on a swimsuit. after lots of searching and reading reviews to try to find a bathing suit for a newly postpartum body, i went for it. i am so happy that i did - it fits perfectly. snug in all the right places, and makes my extra baby pudge seem nonexistent. before baby i was a bikini-only kind of girl, so i wasn't sure how i'd feel in a one piece in this style. it really is better than i could have imagined. i highly recom	1
I fell in love with this top when i saw it online. i love tracy reese! the pattern is beautiful and the yellow is even brighter in person. i ordered a size small even though i normally wear an xs in all tops. for whatever reason, there was no xs offered, which is odd. the straps are adjustable which is good but unfortunately you absolutely cannot wear this top without fashion tape to keep the straps from falling off your shoulders. the straps slipped off my shoulders constantly. i wore a coobie	1
I ordered a size xl in ivory. it's prettier in person. there are great details. it shrunk a bit after washing and air-drying. i cut off the layer of chiffon around the neckline to make it more comfortable. a cute summer tank.	1
"I'm in love, i'm in love, and i don't care who knows it. i bought this vest on a whim and i'm so glad i did. it's so soft and cozy. the medium brown color makes it highly versatile as well. i've tried the faux fur vests and they are too bulky for my taste, but this was not bulky at all. warm and hangs well. i am 5'5"", 135lbs, curvy/athletic frame and the small was just right. try this vest on...i promise you will be in love!"	1
I got this in light green and it's a gorgeous color. first tried a small, but it was a little too wide and long. exchanged for xs, looks great. now i just hope it doesn't shrink too much!	1
"I love hess overalls. they are true to size and have a great vintage look to them but done in a classic way. i am 5'6"" 125lbs and a 34b. i bought the xs and it fit great! they are fitted and not sloppy like a lot of overalls. you can easily dress them up or down. soft and stretchy material is a plus"	1
"I ordered these pants after seeing the good reviews, but i don't agree. these are going back. i ordered a small. i'm 5'5"" and 135 pounds. i am usually between a small and a medium in pants, but the small in these pants is huge. i could definitely fit into an xs. but i also don't think they are very flattering and don't like the feel of the fabric. it's too bad. i love the idea of these."	0
Love this shirt. it's easy to throw on and makes a cute outfit with about any kind of bottoms. i've wore it with leggings and jeans.	1
"This dress is absolutely charming. i could not find the petite size, so i went with the 0 regular. it was too, too large for me. felt more like a size 4. i am 5'2"" and 112 pounds, thought the 0 would fit. the fabric is soft, the style charming and it is easy to fold and take on a trip- it didn't wrinkle in the package it was shipped in."	1
The fabric is a nice weight knit and the top generally well made. unfortunately, the fit was enormous. i've an athletic build w/ big boobs & normally wear l in retailer tops.	0
I got these in the mail today and to me, they look exactly like the pants my mamaw used to wear in the 80s. they were super comfy but not cute at all on me. they do run large like other reviews say. i am usually an 8/10 or med and these in the small were the right choice. going back because they just look horrible on me though	0
Easy to wear and very cute, especially for curvy ladies. but, i think it looks best worn with a best, or a blazer on top, something to emphasize the waist a bit more.	1
"I've been trying on ""boyfriend"" jeans for more than a year, finally found a pair that fit and were comfortable. many of them had no stretch at all and were very uncomfortable. these have just enough stretch, but not too much. i usually wear a 29-30, tried on the 29 which were comfortable but too loose at the waist. the 28 were a perfect fit. i'm 5'8"", 140lbs."	1
Wearing this to a weeding in july. its so feminine and pretty. runs a little big on top at the arm holes, but having it tailored - love!!!!	1
Wish i would have read the reviews before i purchased and wore two of these. washed as directed and same outcome as everyone else. basically unwearable unless i maybe use it for a nightshirt. the shrinkage lengthwise was ridiculous. glad i didn't buy every color like i had planned to do!	0
This is the perfect warm cozy boho sweater. the blue trim really stands out and brightens up the grey. this sweater will look cute over any outfit, or with jeans. i have long arms, and the sleeves almost cover my hands, which i really like. i highly recommend this, especially at 20% off!	1
I typically wear a 4/6 but am a little bigger right now, so i went with the medium. was so excited to get these but was very disappointed when i tried them on. they look beautiful, but there is no lining, leaving the fabric uncomfortable. they were also huge! definitely make sure you size down if you d	0
I wanted to love this shirt. it's got a thicker material, a flattering shape and the uniqueness for a basic top. however when i put this on, it just looked like it was ill-fitting over the chest. i think if the pull was below the chest, it would be much better.	1
It was very pretty,but it ran very big , sadly i had to return it.	0
Love the dress. runs a little big. i ordered a size down than i normally wear and it fit. versatile too--i even wore it to the office with a black blazer over it and got lots of compliments!	1
This skirt is a great length and nice piece for fall/winter. i love the color. it fits like a high waisted skirt would which is why i purchased the next size up.	1
This top is really beautiful. my girlfriend saw it on a rack outside the dressing room, or i would not have seen it. i tried it on, and loved it instantly. it does run a bit big, and i ordered the extra small to make sure which one would work. the photos don't do it justice. reminds me of retailer of 10 years ago, when just about everything in the store was truly unique.	1
I initially bought this in the stone color and loved it so much the first time i wore it that i went back for the red. without a doubt my favorite purchases of the season. have gotten so many compliments on both and despite the fact that the style isn't form fitting, it is still somehow very flattering. would highly recommend this sweater to anyone!	1
I love this blazer because it feels like a sweater but has the formal structure of a blazer. great for fall!	1
This tank seemed like it should have been a maternity top. way too much fabric, not flattering for those of us with a larger bust. i am wearing a medium in the photos and for reference my measurements are 38-30-40.	0
I would have loved this sweater if it were true to the picture but the stripes are gray, not white. either i got a strange one or (as happens to me sometimes with retailer) the pictures are very misleading. disappointed because i wanted to love this.	0
Really pretty color, light, breathable fabric and i love the high neck on this tunic! i wear this tunic with black leggings, a black tank and black sandals. i'm not the smallest girl so i love that this tunic is a bit longer and has a bit of a belt. wonderful pick up!	1
Love the design of this top. wish i could have gotten it in white but was sold out. it fits nicely overall, but is a little snug in the stomach area. still kept it though, because the shirt is just so pretty!	1
I love this dress, even more when i ordered it. its really flowy and flattering. i was worried it would make me look a bit frumpy with the seam right under the bust, but its so flattering. it also has little ties on the sleeeves in the back, a detail i'm in love with.	1
This is a modernized hippie sweater, so beautiful. blue is more for fall but i think the mustard color has more personality. the large flowers add attitude, pockets show comfort. it is soft (part silk fabric) and lays nicely. it is not thick enough for warmth, but there is room for a tissue turtleneck. regular s fits me well (it should be relaxed look, not fitted) and i wear it as a dress with thick tights and boots (i am 5ft2in, 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips, and the hem falls right above my knees).	1
This is truly a lovely dress. the colors are beautiful and i love the contrasting but complimentary fabrics which add interest to an already elegant dress. the material is substantial without being stiff so that it flows gracefully and it flatters the figure. in my opinion if fits true to size, i'm 32b, 5' and 103lbs and i got it in a 2p which is the size i normally get in dresses. it is slightly more loose than other retailer dresses in the same size but it still follows your curves without being	1
Love this skirt ! i thought it would be much shorter but when i tried it on it was the perfect length and super cute!! the material is thick but not uncomfortable and very move able!	1
"The quality of this top is wonderful. thick enough to prevent see-through, but thin enough to create a beautiful drape. the fringe details are lovely. the top is slightly roomy (ranks between ""true to size"" and ""runs large,"" i.e., leaves room in the back when i clasp my hands together and stretch them out in front of me), but not really enough to size up. i'm 5'-4"", 120 lbs., athletic build, and the small fits well. my only issue with the aesthetic is that the pattern of the lace on the upper pa"	1
This top is cute, light and summery. ordered a small...is a little short/boxy but otherwise fits true to size. great summer/warm weather top!	1
I absolutely love mother jeans, but i unfortunately had to return these ones. this particular style seemed to run pretty small. too, i always size up in white jeans, and even the size up that i had ordered were just too tight. i typically wear a 28 in mother, and ordered a 29 in these.	0
Love the pilcro brand, they are one of my favorites, even compared to other more expensive denim brands. i ordered my usual two sizes smaller and found they did not fit this time! i probably should have ordered one size smaller than my usual in this cut. sadly, i have to send these beauties back and hope for a pop-back.	1
"Soft, cozy, and the heathered off-white/palest gray is a great cool-toned neutral. the only surprise was that it is lightweight; not nearly as warm as it looks. the hood has a fuzzy sherpa lining, the unlined jacket has a soft fleece or flannel finish on the inside with zigzag seams, the ouside looks like a sweatshirt. it does work great as a top layer though. 50% polyester, 38% cotton, 12% rayon. . got this in a size 's' to fit my hips and it works out great. i'm 5'2"", currently 33-25-37ish, wi"	1
After seeing an influx of this dress in my instagram feed i decided to go ahead and purchase it last weekend. i'm usually leery with the length of swing dresses, for instance the endora swing dress (paper crown) is a touch too short for my taste in petite sizing. either way, i decided to go ahead and purchase this dress in petite considering no previous reviews mentioned the length of the dress to be an issue.  typically, i take a size 0 or xs in retailer clothing. i ordered a size 0 petite and	1
Going to alter shoulders straps by shortening for a better fit. petite size would have fit better, but was sold out.	1
"The high neck and ""square-ness"" did not work for me .. but might for someone else."	0
Cute kitty sweater! i'm 5 feet 105 # and went with a regular size xs instead of petite and it hits perfectly!  yes it's itchy it wool! but i plan on wearing mine with a high/low tee under it. so cute!	1
I own another dolan dress which is virtually the same as this but has long sleeves. i wear the long-sleeved one whenever i give presentations or readings. the material is absolutely genius for travel. just unpack, shake it out and you're good to go. i love the sleeves on this short-sleeved version. i'm fairly fit but at my age i'm not excited about showing off my arms! the drape is beautiful and i can wear high heels, bootees or flats with it. i bought the red. sometimes you can't tell if the c	1
"Love this vest! saw it and bought it instantly. i'm 5'8"" and slim and got the xs. it fits perfectly. there is a lot of ""puff"" to it, but it's really warm and soft."	1
Since i only wear midi skirts, love the length of this one. the regular medium looks as pictured on me. well made and the dot texture is sweet. bui will be returning as the skirt is literally very heavy and the gathered waist is unflattering on me.	1
I was so stoked about this swim suit.  i bought it for mine and and my husband's anniversary trip.  it didn't disappoint.  it was gorgeous.  amazing quality. fabulous on.  unfortunately in my case though - the bottom is incredibly low cut and showed my c-section scar. so it had to go back :(	1
I ordered this dress in the blue color. it is lovely in person - but the petite seemed to run smaller than most petite dresses i buy from retailer. i ordered a 2p - and it was tight in the bust on me. i imagine a 4p would be perfect. i am 117 5'3 34b.	1
I purchased this dress in white and am quite happy with the fit and design. not too fancy but definitely not casual either. easy to dress up or down and can be worn for various occasions. the fit is great, but i do wish it was not so lose around the belly (it truly is fine though). has more of the hanging feel than the fitted feel. very comfortable for an evening out.	1
Love, love these flannel sleep pants. i bought a pair 3 years ago and have been on the look out for the style again. these are truly the most comfortable pajama pants i have ever owned.	1
"I bought two, one in white and one in blue print and wore the blue print top once and loved it. then i washed it according to the instructions on the tag (in cold gentle cycle and hung to dry). it shrunk up 4"" in the length and 2"" in the width and now it doesn't fit at all. also, after one wear, the buttons are coming off (before i even put it in the wash) and it's covered in loose threads. the quality is just not there. i'm going to return both and show the sales lady the difference in size on"	0
I saw this and was hoping to try it so i went to the closest retailer.. the design of this dress is fantastic but if you have curvy hips this is going to cause you problems. i am 32c-24-35... i have a definite curve between my waist and hips and it totally interfered with the line of the dress. i think if you are straighter between your waist and hips or you are long waisted then this lovely dress is for you. the waist line was simply too long. i needed the dress to flare out higher. the to	1
What a great find! this is so easy to dress up or down and a very comfortable fit and fabric. the skirt fabric is pretty form fitting so not something i can comfortably wear to work but it's a versatile piece otherwise. the buttons on the sleeve are a nice touch.	1
This dress is nice, but it won't do for my purpose. i considered it for a mother of the groom dress, but it's not long enough for me. the dress is pretty, but very sheer and very low cut so it would require opaque undergarments. it's not possible to tell from the pictures how sheer this dress is.	0
From the moment i saw this top i knew i had to have it. the colors of the embroidery are just so beautiful. it is even prettier in person than it is online!!	1
"I would not have purchased this had i not seen it at my local (2 hrs away!) store. as the previous review mentioned, the red is gorgeous! very saturated color, just lovely. it does run large. i am 5'10"", 135lbs. i typically wear medium but chose small and could possibly have done xs but i wanted the extra length."	1
What a find! this skirt is so soft and fits like a dream. perfect shape and length. i've been looking for more pieces to match a couple of fabulous pairs of purple shoes i have, so this is just the ticket!	1
I thought this shirt was really feminine and elegant. only downsides is some of the punched out holes had fabric still attached which you have cut off with scissors- otherwise the shirt will snag. and the second issue of bigger importance are the low armholes. lots of bra showing- not really sure how to get around that so i always wear it with a cardigan. but it would be nice not to have to.  other than that it looks nice and pairs nicely with almost anything.	1
I love the design of this sweater...shorter length, with shorter sleeves. goes great with jeans and has a very different look!	1
I wanted to love this, as it seemed like a fun and carefree take on a little black dress. but how did i not see that this has tassels? but they're there, a whole row of them - look hear the bottom of the skirt part, between the colorful stripes and the lacy area. that's a deal breaker for me - i really can't stand the way these look, and they're not the sort of thing you can easily remove. the fabric, though nice quality, has no stretch at all. i wasn't expecting stretch, but i'd just say	0
"I hesitated purchasing this because of the high price, so kept waiting and then the petite sizes ran out so i figured i missed it. then miraculously the petite in the green was available so i went for it. this sweater is yummy and cozy. drapes beautifully. i am 5'1"" , short waisted, and wear size 2 in most clothes. the petite s fits perfectly. with a pair of black leggings and high boots, this is a winner outfit for fall and winter. very comfy. the sweater has a bit of an open-weave, so keep tha"	1
"Ref: 5'4"", 125# 27/4, 32g. i don't think this is for us shorter women. this hits you right where you don't want a vertical line to hit. it flares out at your hip and makes you look shorter than you are. the fabric is like a double gauze and very soft and the colors are beautiful but i couldn't even dream of making this work. i thought maybe with my larger bust it would create shape but it looks like i just wrapped a bunch of fabric around me! glad i tried in-store and didn't online order."	0
Love this vest! i am not a huge vest person, and was worried about finding something to go with this, but i have been able to match it to so many cute thing. the pattern and quality are great. it runs big. if you're between sizes definitely go for the smaller size.	1
"I coveted this dress for so long, but this was a case of the photo giving me a different visual impression than seeing it in real life. the ""gold"" patterns on top aren't shiny and delicate in person as i had imagined, and they actually make a very strong impression up close (and are painted on, it seems). the mesh they lay on is also more coarse than i had hoped. the coolest part about this dress, though, is the shiny, sequined black underlay. the photo doesn't do that component justice. i was s"	0
This jacket is the best! definitely my staple jacket for the spring. it is so comfortable and soft. i usually wear a small in retailer clothing, but i opted for the medium in this so there's a little room for layering. even with the extra room, it is so flattering. i absolutely love this jacket!	1
I purchased this shirt online. i thought it would be perfect for work, but when i tried it on, i couldn't even button half the buttons. it is also extremely see-through, and even a nude or white cami underneath would look really odd. need to return, unfortunately. if the top came in other colors, i would return for a larger size, but i can't deal with see-through work tops.	0
I got the moss color in this cardigan. i'm not sure why these aren't sold out because it is pretty amazing! it is super soft and is a cute addition to a casual outfit. i would say that for this price it's definitely worth the buy!	1
This top was really cute but the side slits were just a little to high for my taste. maybe a size up would have worked better.	1
When i first saw this in the store, i loved the idea of this shirtdress with a twist. i tried it on in my usual size 4 but could not get it over my 32d bust. i wrote it off and moved on. back in the store shopping for a party dress, i saw this was now on sale. although not right for the party, i decided to try it in a bigger size. a size 6 was not available but a size 8 was. perfection! if you are willing to size up, you will be rewarded with a comfortable, versatile dress that can be super casu	1
"This top is so cute! love the stripes in the red print and the detailing of the buttons. however, it does run slightly big! i'm 5'8"", 145 and got the medium. it's so low in the front that i do have to wear a cami underneath. i see why they designed it a little larger since it comes up on the sides and it's supposed to be more of a relaxed fit. i typically love when shirts are long since i'm a little taller and this one hits perfectly in the front. it does dip down in the back and covers my bum ("	1
Totally love this sweater - everything about it i find to match the model pics (fit, color, length). no dry cleaning required on this one, so i plan to get other colors to wear with leggings and skinnies fall through winter. i love that this is oversized without looking frumpy - it does have some shape to it and the knit falls perfects (not a heavy/chunky sweater...think soft mid-weight that you can layer with). worth full price!	1
This dress is absolutely adorable. runs true to size, i am five foot nine and a medium fit perfect. the denim has a lot of stretch. i can't wait to wear it in the winter with tights and boots! don't wait too long before this one sells out.	1
This sweater is much more cropped than shown. the sweater i received was only 24 inches long. the color of the trim is black, not the navy or plum that i expected. quality does seem good.	0
Just purchased these online and couldn't wait to try them on! they are soft, comfortable and my new favorite pair of jeans! i love them! i am 5'8 and sz. 29...the color and quality are above my expectations :)	1
"I love this top. the quality is excellent. the blouse is lined and falls nicely.. i like to wear it with a pair of dark gray jeans. the color is described as ""orange"", but it really has more of a bronze tone. looks very rich and exotic. it's perfect top when you want to wear jeans, but want to dress it up a bit."	1
Fits like a maternity top. not for my age group or build.	0
I ordered the black and white pattern, which was ok. i got a small, but the shirt was very square - with a short and wide fit! i doubt an xs would have helped with such a boxy shirt. sent this one back.	0
I love the pilcro pants and so when i saw these level 99 shorts i just had to order. they arrived and are as good as i hoped. the fit is great, the length is great (i don't like shorty shorts) and i love the color. the photo is very true to life in regard to color. i will definitely get a lot of use from these this coming summer.	1
Very nice long-sleeved shirt. the fabric is soft and warm. you can wear it on its own or easily compliment with a jacket.	1
"I'm 5'7"", 125 lbs and i ordered these in a size small. i just got them in the mail and the print is really pretty and they seem very well-made. unfortunately, they were a little too small, particularly around my butt. after i ordered them, i read reviews on other merchants' websites and saw that many other stores recommend sizing up, as the brand is known to run small. i wish i had known before i ordered, but i'm exchanging them for a medium and i hope those fit better, because this suit is ador"	1
If i stopped eating for a couple of months or jumped into a time machine and set the dial for 1990 i would really enjoy this beautifully made delicate blouse. the problem area is evident looking at the photo --the tiny tight fitted gorgeous bodice. i will keep this piece becasue i love it so and the apocolypse is apparently imminent and i have hardly any food in the house.	1
Similar to the previous reviewer, i'm also between sizes and for pencil skirts it's usually the larger size that end up fitting. whether this skirt runs large or maybe because it has a slight stretch, my smaller size (10) fits perfectly and seems comfortable enough to wear on a long flight or road trip. the fabric is wonderful, the skirt length is great for work, and the styling is really nice with added detail of buttoned loops at the waist. if i had one negative comment it would be an itty bit	1
I expected this dress to be a much better fit and quality overall--the size small fit me fine--i'm about 140 and small in the chest, but the zipper was incredibly cheap and the dress could've draped in a more attractive way. if this dress could be in cotton and given more consideration to the fit and drape, it'd be worth it, but it's going back.	0
I wanted to love these, they are cute and warm - but they have absolutely no elasticity. i'm so mad at myself for not reading the reviews because i ended up wasting money on shipping 2 pairs of leggings that i ultimately took right back to the store.	0
Recently, i have been so wanting to get a lightwash denim jacket and i found the piece right here! i love that its cropped and so easy to wear. its not stiff at all and sized right. i got an xs my normal size and its so comfy and surprisingly soft.  great find but just a bit pricey.. but probably bc its paige. too bad pilcrow couldn't have made something like this.	1
Falls beautifully and the color is vibrant. can be dressed up or worn casually. texture adds even more uniqueness. a little heavy but this is outweighed by its other lovely features.	1
"Dress appears to be slim fit, but that's far from the case. usually wear an xs regular because i have a long torso for my 5'3"", but it just hung on me like a heavy sack. i have a hard time finding dresses now that i'm not working and like to have a couple on hand for all purpose occasions--weddings, memorials, special occasions. i hoped this one would meet my needs. disappointed."	0
I ordered this in yellow after the size small in store didn't fit. it's such a cute summer top, perfect with cropped jeans! i'm a 32b and usually a size small but had to size down. i could still see the top of my strapless bra in the front so i wear a lacy bandeau with it and it's super cute. because of this though, i wouldn't pay full price so i'm happy it was on sale!	1
Like the other reviewer mentioned, this jacket has a very trim fit, so size up if you want any extra wiggle room or are not a fan of snug clothing. i liked the warm neutral color and the gathered ruched detail up the front. ultimately i did not buy it due to the sleeves being a bit long and the style more body-hugging than what i was looking for. but it is comfortable and a nice twist on a classic.	1
Saw this online when it first came up and thought it looked lovely. i purchased a different pleated dress and decided i didn't need a second pleated dress. was at my local retailer and they had one pink dress in a size 4 and a blue in a 0. decided to try them both on. the zero actually fit perfectly and at the sale price i had to have it. the material is beautiful, little details like the ruffled hem are lovely. one i will wear for years. thinking about getting the link but the blue is lovely. i'm	1
When i saw this tunic dress, i knew immediately that i would wear it and it would become a favorite of mine. the cut is unique and it is versatile enough to mix and match with many different things. it is also very comfortable, true to size and very good quality material. i highly recommend.	1
I'm keeping these shorts because they are cute. i sized down as the previous reviews suggested and they fit great, but they are snug around the legs. i think i would have preferred a more baggy look, but then they would have been too big around the waist (had i ordered my typical size). they are soft and comfortable, the navy color is really pretty.	1
I love the dress overall, however, found it a tad snug in the bust area. overall, a beautiful dress to own.	1
This is a nice shirt, but i can't keep it. i ordered a 0 and i do have an athletic build with somewhat wider shoulders given how petite i am (usually wear 00 petite in all pants) and i think this size was perfect (fit across the back perfectly) when you lift your arms the way it is cut makes it really tight across the chest and shows your stomach. at the same time, the high low styling makes for a really strange shirt-tail in the back. i'm sure this is the trend but it really does not look cute	0
This sweater is gorgeous in print but in person the colors are murkier. the yellow dots are really a dusty mustard yellow and the navy is a smokey navy. the white background reads more oatmeal in person.	1
Love this! fits great. warm and soft. would recommend	1
This is a great skirt. i am always on the lookout for machine washable clothes that are fun and work appropriate. this skirt is really flattering on my body. the only thing that's a little off is the tie at the front but it's still really stunning on.	1
Love the lines of this tweed look jacket. pockets are a definite plus, as is the soft pleat in the back. this is a good piece to transition from winter to spring. it updates your jeans and soft t-shirt look.	1
"I'm so glad the other reviews were so good. i couldn't agree more. this top is very well made, lined. i'm 5'5"", 32 dd and got the 6. i'll have to take up the shoulders a bit since the v falls a little low on me. what can i say, i'm modest. :) i wish they made more colors. this top is awesome."	1
"I love this blouse. it reminds me of something out of europe with the swiss dot and crochet delicate sleeves. i ordered the xsp and it fits perfect. i'm 4' 11"" so the shortness of the top isn't a factor. the material drapes nicely and doesn't make me look wide or boxy. i was afraid that the sleeves were going to be overly puffy put luckily they are not. the only thing to note is that the color is more on the tan / beige side rather than pink. i find with a lot of retailer tops that the colors are"	1
This dress is gorgeous in the photograph. and very pretty when it arrived, however, it is very dark in color. you would only notice the blue in bright light or perhaps outside in the sun. the fit was small. i could not get the tie around the waist to look right and feel comfortable, so sadly i had to return it.  i applaud retailer for the excellent and attractive packaging. that was almost enough to sell the dress. it came in a very nice white box inside a larger box. tissue paper and fol	1
The embroidery details on this top are beautiful. the material is soft and a really good quality. my first time wearing out and i received so many compliments! i love it!	1
This blouse has too much drapey fabric and it's just not flattering.  in the front part of the blouse the fabric is relatively short, but the sleeves have so much excess fabric it almost looks like a clown suit.  sending back.	0
I really wanted to love this dress, but even though i got a small, it was still too big. i also don't think the horizontal pattern was a good look for me, other than that, it is beautiful and the fabric felt nice.	1
Gorgeous embroidery, soft fabric, great drape, hides tummy--overall perfect.  size down.  i bought the small and i am 36dd.	1
"This skirt looks cute online but, it has several issues. 1.) the slit is very high, this photo is deceptive, look closely...the slit is actually to her finger tips. you cant wear any kind of spanx or control top tights. 2.) slits on both sides so when you walk they fly away. 3.) the micro mini ""slip"" bunches. 4.) the fine knit is very snag-able. 5.) the skirt is very long. it is going back."	0
I wound up returning this shirt, because i ordered the wrong size! so sad. i should have sized down. i'm tall, and long waisted, but slight on top.  the shirt is gorgeous, and the detailing is perfectly done. i'd definitely recommend trying this one. just choose your size carefully..	1
Bummed out.. this is super cheaply made and very expensive... the design is different , the color is beautiful, but the material is a different story.. it should be priced at the most 30 bucks.. not 128.. i'm returning them. also, they run very big..!	0
This shirt is so small. i am not sure who came up with the sizing but you have to go up several sizes to get a comfortable fit. don't waste your time on this shirt. such a shame, it could have been very cute.	0
In person the colors are prettier and it's more interesting than the front shot in the model. i tried on and bought my regular medium. got home and tried it on and realized it's too big:(	1
Can't pants. the material is lightweight and perfect for summer. however i felt they were cut narrow in the hips. i am a solid size 30/8 and i couldn't get the 30 over my hips.	1
Comfortable material, fits true to size, love the color and can wear all year round. selected this dress for a fall wedding and its a keeper!	1
I got a medium as i usually wear that in everything. i am a 36d and this pulled a bit across my chest and back. it is a cute idea, but the fit is off for my body. i am 5'6 and hits me shorter than shown on the model, so hits at an odd length. i may try to order a large and see if it is better on me, because i am so hopeful for this to look cute on me! the teal blue color is beautiful, the pink is more a blush and washed me out, the grey is just grey. i bought three thinking this would be my go t	1
"I ordered this dress on a whim because i love the classic look, it has long sleeves, and the color is beautiful. i can't tell if there is sparkle in person, it looks like it on pictures, or holes... but regardless, love it. i tried on both xxs p and xs p and found the xs p was more comfortable for me, for those who find clothing at retailer is being made bigger, this is more a ""classic"" size, as in what i would have ordered in the past (this summer, i had to go down in size a lot). the fabric is c"	1
I have to be honest, i wear this away from the pool more than to the pool. it is extremely lightweight and comfortable, making it the perfect loungewear to tackle this california heat, and the style is fabulous- love the hassles and beads on the ties.	1
This skirt was too big so i returned it but did like it well enough to re-order. quality seems average; my only complaint is the lining seems too short for the skirt. why, on a maxi, is the slip lining a mini? the first thing my husband said was that it needed a slip. he didn't think it had one as he could see through the skirt to my knees. this is very lightweight fabric but could be worn all year around depending on the leg wear that is worn with it. it is a very versatile piece which is why i	1
Very cozy lounge tee, but runs large. i ordered a small rather than my usual medium and could of probably went down two sizes.	1
I felt like a 12 year old wearing my big sister's dress. it's a bit too roomy and long for my frame in my normal size large, hitting below my knees. the top part fits my large, 34g chest nicely but it becomes a wide a-line through the hips. the fabric is a bit thick like a sweatshirt knit so it doesn't flow softly over the body. the fabric of the lace vee insert at the hem is thick and looks awkward.  i love the black and white stripes. very striking. would love a top in these colors and fabric,	1
I ordered my usual size 8 but this run huge, i had to exchange for 6 or even size 4. the fabric is nice and airy. it seems to easily wrinkle though. just have to either iron everytime or dry clean i suppose. unique design.	1
Love this top! super comfortable, great fit, and really pretty colors. probably going to buy it in multiple colors it fits so great.	1
Bought this shirt in mid-july, washed twice (cold, delicate) and hung to dry. already holes/falling apart	0
Love these pants. i have several pairs of the pilcro scrip (and formerly super script). these do not have quite as much elastic as some cuts, but they still fit well and look great.	1
Ok, if i had a different body, this would be awesome but i have a big butt and meaty thighs so just did not flatter me. although my husband couldn't tell that the pants were tugging on me (thanks to the pattern it does camouflage), it was uncomfortable. so if you are built like me, this isn't the jumpsuit for you.  this is a well made garment but there is no give in the butt and thigh area (hence would not recommend for my thick thighed sisters).  for reference, i am 5'3 and 150 pounds. th	0
Love this dress! the color is gorgeous! what you don't see until you see the dress in person is the beautiful detail of the stitched flowers on the dress. i received so many compliments when i wore this dress. the sleeves are sheer and the material light weight. you can wear this dress year round. i love these kind of dresses! retailer knows how to do this right! love this store!	1
This dress is absolutely fantastic. beautiful, high-quality, and fits like a glove. even better than i could have imagined.	1
I wore out a pair of level 99 shorts a couple of years ago. ordered these in the same size and they are huge. so i am sending them in for exchange and hope i'm guessing right. linen and tencel are my two favorite summer fabrics. love the length which can be adjusted by rolling. good pockets. gorgeous somewhat dusty plum color. belt loops if needed though i rather hope they're not.	1
You can't go wrong with these pants. as other reviews point out when they say skinny they do mean that this is a skinny fit so order accordingly. i ordered a 4 when i have been wearing 2s in many other styles and was glad for the 4. i thought the fabric was all season so don't agree with some other reviewers regarding the stiffness of the fabric. i think it's perfect. everyone is different. these are pretty close to year-round wearable.	1
This is a tts basic tee with the added flare of the ruffled back peplum and the elegance of the beaded front neckline. the beading is lovely and mine was intact. i bought my normal small based on reviews and the fit was perfect. (34-b) the beige color is a classic neutral and can be worn year round by just adding a jacket or sweater. love it!	1
"I am normally a m-l (170 lbs, 5'4"", 34dd). i ordered this top in a medium knowing it ran big, and it is huge. seriously, i could wear it as a dress. i like the whole loose and comfy top thing, but this is so massive it looks sloppy. i'm going try and return it for a small. hey, i like that i can wear a small! the green color really is pretty, and it's so soft. just need a much smaller size."	1
Wow, wow, wow! this is so retailer! the dress is more breathtaking in person, it is a beautiful work of art from top to bottom. the fabric is super soft and flows perfectly. the lining is super soft as well, and it doesn't fall all the way down to the hem so that the burnout detail would show through on the bottom. i don't like spaghetti straps but the straps are very sturdy and high quality, very comfortable. fyi, the color is much richer (a shade darker) in person, like an eggplant color. i orde	1
Horrible fit not true to size again aline outside of the dress and a very tight camisole underneath	0
I'm just not sure about this top... it's very short. i'm short-waisted, and it could stand to be at least an inch longer in front for me. and as another reviewer pointed out, there's no closure in front. i can't imagine wearing it without a tank underneath... one good stiff breeze and everyone would get a peep show. it really seems more like a vest than a shirt. it's cute enough with a tank underneath, but that sort of defeats the purpose of an easy summer top... it's too hot for layers in the s	1
I want to wear this skirt every day - it's so much fun to wear and versatile and i just feel great wearing it! can dress it up or down - it's pretty darn fabulous! i highly recommend it - you'll be grateful and feel pretty!	1
"I got this top in the ""brown"" color, although it is really more of a burnt rose, or light sienna shade and it is just lovely. i love the color. the fit is just right, comfortable and a good length. it feels very well-made and has beautiful details from the pleated collar/neckline to the slightly sheer upper back panel. i have only one tiny issue with this top: in the very front where it buttons, there is no lining or fabric behind the crocheted lace panels. in retrospect, i can see this slightly"	1
This is now one of my favorite items in my wardrobe!! it is comfortable yet can be dressed up or down to fit any occasion.	1
"I am a loyal retailer shopper, but find many items are hit or miss. this definitely is a hit especially in black! i am 5'4"" 125 lbs and 36ddd. i usually take a m or m petite in retailer tops. because this is flowy and long, a s petite fits perfectly. the style is one-of-a-kind, the lace is heavy and top quality, and when you try on the right size, it hits perfectly. the lavender is a dusty shade that won't work well in fall/winter. it would look wonderful in cranberry or forest green."	1
"This dress is just as it looks in the pictures. shapeless. the trick is to add some styling to it. add the pilcro dark denim jacket and the headwaters scarf, and your all set. i had on black seychelle loafers but would pair it with a black d'orsay flat. the top blue of the dress is a faded sun washed looking navy and it goes well with the black of the skirt. i usually wear a 4 in dresses and the xs in this dress fit well. i'm 5'3ish"", 118#, 34d-dd. this is going to be a nice winter to spring dre"	1
"Don't know why but i didn't have high expectations for this dress. turns out it's uber flattering! makes my waist look tiny, accentuated bust. perfect for those of us with straight figures looking for a little more curves. bottom half of dress has heavy silky linking. top half unlined and a bit thin. color is almost pearl -- very very light gray. i'm between xs/s (33b-26-36, 5'8"" 120lb) and went with a small. hits an inch above knees. sleeves slightly loose through upper arm which is always bett"	1
This top is a departure from my usual style, but i had to give it a try because it looked so comfy yet structured. i wish the material was less sheer as i have to wear a cami underneath when i wear it to work. i'm 5'3 / 135lb and the 6 fits just fine.	1
This is a very nice bra, upset though because this is the second time i have ordered something from retailer and the place that the product was made was incorrect on the website. bra was made in peru and website said usa. makes it very hard to be socially responsible on this website. not sure i will continue to shop retailer in the future because of this.	1
I loved the look of this sweater on-line, but it just didn't work for me. the fit wasn't good enough. the style okay. the color fine. the feel, scratchy. overall, it did not work for my body.	0
Beautiful, comfortable and attractive sweater! my neckline doesn't stay flat as the one in the photo does, but i love the sweater anyway. great quality, attractive, and comfortable.	1
I loved the lavender color on the cape. it was soft and comfortable. but the design on the front ruined it for me. it took me all of 1 minute to know it was going back. it looked like florescent bird feathers nothing wrong with that, it just wasn't my style at all. i was a bit disappointed as it would have been perfect for cool ca nights. it looked more subdued in the photo, it's not. i clicked i would recommend to others as it is nicely made and i guess just not my taste as far as the colors an	1
Perfect in every way- easy to wear-very feminine, comfy and goes with everything. only problem is color is not like picture. it is a mauve not a light pink. i still love this top and the color it camre in. brighten up with lipstick- necklace- earrings- whatever your pick. highly recommend. a winner!!!	1
This great weekend staple is the perfect lightweight jacket. it has a roomy, comfortable fit but the drawstring helps you create a bit of a waist. got lots of compliments on the embroidery.	1
So many compliments and so comfortable--all i want from a pair of pants. i am 5'8+ and around 135 and a little bit of a pear, and these fit perfectly in size 28l. they felt a little tight at first and then stretched to be ideal. i bought black and really love the softness, the rise, and the way they go with everything. thinking of going back for one in the dark red. this will be a winter staple to dress up or down.  i just hope they don't wear out too quickly!	1
Love these.  i bought the grey which is a grey/taupe/light olive chameleon.  totally depends upon what i wear with them.  the rolled up cuff is adorable and the material is perfect.  the fit is true to size - tight but not restrictive.  comfy all day long.   and best of all, they don't stretch out over the day.   i'm 5'10, a size 6 normally and a size 28 fit me perfectly.	1
"Stylist at my local retailer recommended i try on this top. as soon as i put it on, i was amazed at how pretty it is. i'm 5'3"" and curvy size medium and the fit is true to size. i would say if you are between sizes, you may want to size down. i didn't have any issues with the lace and the slight v-neck falls perfectly on me. no need to wear any cami.  my only concern was how wrinkled the top was. i requested to have the blouse steamed before i left the store so that i could see if all of the wrin"	1
"Beautifully embroidered dress.  it's loose fitting, not meant to be tailor fitted, so it would run large to you if that's what you were expecting.  the colors are gorgeous and the skirt has a really beautiful flow.  if you are hoping for a fitted look, size down one size.  there is plenty of stretch to this dress and plenty of room in the bust and waist.  i generally go between 00p and 0p, and got this in a 0p (though either would work).  it comes to just above my knees at 5'2"", 110, 32-24.5-32."	1
No. this is one of the most unflattering things i've ever put on my body. i'm a very well-proportioned hourglass - i tend to wear a small despite a booty and 36d chest - this made me look huge. don't do it.	0
This romper was not what i expected when i originally purchased. it is much more casual looking in person, and as soon as i got it out of the bag, one of the buttons fell off. it did look good on and fit well, but i will be returning because it is too casual for the occasion i bought it for.	0
This is a great staple top for your closet. its tremendously soft, a bit oversized, and drapes really lovely. in store there were also striped styles available, but i love the emerald green. the colors are absolutely perfect and will transfer well into any season! my only issue with this top (which inevitably is the reason i decided not to purchase) is the dolman sleeve. i'm al xl on top...so i'm never looking for extra width in anything i wear. the dolman sleeve really only looks right on me if	1
"This is cuter in person, more of a brown than a cream like in the picture. it runs a little smaller than i was expecting, but that's actually good for me as things usually are a little loose up top. i'm 5'6"", 120 lbs, 32c, and an xs fit well for a sexier look, but if you're wanting it a little looser, i would go up one size."	1
Cute, light summer dress. wish it worked for me. the tank part of the dress is light and super comfy. the bottom part of the dress is narrow and a bit fitted, doesn't work for a curvy bottomed girl.	1
I tried this on (xs) and thought it would be great, butit was simply bog on me and boxy. unfortunately, they are out of petite in the grey color (my favorite of the 3). this top is soft and feminine if it fits properly, but too big was a little too boxy.	1
Lovely dress in bright teal color. the zipper was a bit sticky as the other reviewers had mentioned. unfortunately i sized up (6) based on past reviews and had to exchange for a smaller size(4). the fabric does have a bit of stretch so i'm really not sure why so many people had sizing issues. this is really a great buy with the current sale. tempted to pick up the red version too.	1
"Don't pass this one up ladies....the fabric is casual and relaxed, but the drawstring-like collar gives it class and flirt all at the same time. i paired it with a jersey mini skirt and the way the banding at the waist falls on this top made it look like one whole dress. i can wear this with cropped jeans, shorts, anything! truly a homerun. i'm 5'10"", 138lbs and small fit perfectly."	1
I don&amp;#39;t write many reviews but i loved this dress and had to share! i&amp;#39;m normally about a true 6 and have been finding a lot of retailer dresses running rather large. i tried this on in the store in a 2 and because of the stretch in it, it fit my hourglass shape really well. i have a melodies that pencil dress in a 6p that fits great so this style i think runs a bit larger. i wore it to a date night and it helped make the evening special.	1
I received this skirt today and am absolutely thrilled! as a short and curvy lady, i feel most comfortable in fuller skirts (but not too poofy), and this one lies perfectly (does not make my hips look wide!). the colors are soft and very feminine, which also suits my style. it may seem like a springtime skirt, but i will start wearing it with tights and a sweater right away.	1
This jacket is far more attractive than on the website. i would have passed this up had i not seen it in the store. the embroidered sleeve detail is intricate with raised cream colored stitching surrounded by small brass beads on a rich, olive green background. blue detail sets this off as a unique statement piece that will surely draw compliments. i am 5'1, 110 lbs. and the extra small regular fit fine. i considered a petite but the salesperson thought the longer length would look better so i w	1
"I too was immediately drawn to this dress online and was this close to ordering a petite when i stopped my my local retailer and they had just gotten it in, in regular only. of course i tried it on (in the xs regular) and was thrilled to find it fit perfectly and was so flattering on my hourglass figure. i'm 5'1"" and 115 with a 32 dd chest. no gaping or pulling, the waist and shoulders were where they should be and i found the length, with the hi/lo hem to be just above my knees in front. i think"	1
"I need to start by saying i'm 5' 10"". i think that's why i love this dress so much. it's not too short on me like so many. it is a classic fit that is flattering on me. the raw edge detail makes it a little more fun then just a strapless denim dress and the pockets are the best! i love dresses with pockets! they don't stick out weird or anything either. the only negative which prevents the perfect 5 star review is the bottom is fuller than i would like. a-line is a little misleading. it's defini"	1
This sweater is perfect! finally a sweater that doesn't make me look like a huge box! i bought the blue & it has other colors running through it so i'll be able to wear it with chinos & jeans. very pretty, flattering & i think i'm going to be wearing this a lot.	1
Love this top!! i bought it for school and im dying to wear it. i could see how other people could dislike it bc of the loose frame, but if you like flowy shirts this top is for you! i like how the shirt is made of a really soft and sturdy cotton and the top part is more fitted so the fabric doesnt completely drown you out. also, this top looks super cute paired w/ a bralette and espadrilles!	1
I was pleasantly surprised when i tried on this sweater. it is well made and fit perfect. the will really enjoy weather this in the fall.	1
I love this skirt. it does run a little small, i ordered an extra small and it is tight at the waist, but still works. i have received more compliments on this skirt than maybe anything i have owned. i've been stopped at the grocery store by people telling me how much they like it. i also work with kids, and they all love it as well.	1
This is a unique blouse, it reminds me of the unique items i would find at the store many years ago. it is a gorgeous item. it does have a boxy fit, but it is not unflattering. i am very pleased with this purchase and would recommend this product.  the quality is nice and it is an item that people will notice.	1
I love this dress. it is so flattering and comfortable! i am petite with curves, and feel so good when wearing this. i ordered a petite small. i will have to stop myself from wearing it every day this summer.	1
"I found these jeans to be more fitted than slouchy.  for reference, i'm 5'4"" and 160#. i'm heavier thru the hips and thighs and ordered both the 31 & 32 petite (i usually take 32 p in pilcro) and the 32 fit well but was by no means slouchy. however, still very flattering and unique. i had purchased the other pilcro em in 32 p and they did fit looser and i would also recommend that style. always count on pilcro for great fit and style."	1
Very cute dress but the skirt flares out more than it looks in the picture. this made my midsection look unflattering from the side. also, for some who is on the flat chested side, you need a good bra or alteration (at least for me). despite what i listed above, i kept the dress since it's a versatile dress for many occasions.	1
I just purchased this adorable tank on-line and already received it in my regular size small (34d-27-35) and it fits me tts. the material is actually made with 100% rayon, not polyester as it describes above which makes it even better. the embroidery very beautiful in person as well and the arm openings are just right, not too large for a nice change. if you need a cute tank in black with a little something special, this is the top for you!	1
Pictures do not do this top justice. looks much cuter in person ! it caught my eye right away in the store. perfect top for when the weather starts getting a little cooler.	1
"Loved the fabric but returning because the armholes are cut waaaaay too low. unless you have 30"" arms, all you get is an unnecessary showing of your bra"	0
I saw this jacket in the store and thought it was really cute..and finally a nice length!! ordered the xl because l and was afraid of shrinkage and it is no larger than the l. runs at least a size small with not alot of give. i will unfortunately have to bring it back.	0
"Love the colors in this top. it's a shame it was so big and baggy i'm not that big a person but really made me look big and frumpy . i am 5'6"", 130#. athlete. size small was way too much material for my frame"	0
I love this vest and could not leave without it. the color and lining just make it perfect, so stylish and comfy! i'm always a 8/10 and a m in this was perfect. the color is so beautiful and its so easy to dress up and down. i am big on the bottom, the tie in the back adds a nice shape to your whole profile and makes it a less boxy vest! love love...	1
The details on this dress are lovely. the embroidery is wonderful. but the fit on this dress is just not for me. it is very baggy and shapeless. it doesn't have any curves at all so it just drapes down me and looks formless. really unflattering. sad but it's going back.	0
My kids gave me this blouse for christmas in my usual size 6. it was so tight through the chest, shoulders and arms. i ended up having to exchange it for at size 10! there was barely any difference in the size 8. unfortunately, i now need to have the sleeves shortened, but as this blouse is so cute, it's worth the effort.	1
I loved this top when i laid eyes on it online, and in person, it did not disappoint. it is a beautiful and unique top. the color is striking and the style is adorable. i can't wait to wear this with some flare jeans and espadrilles.	1
I thought these were very nice bermuda shorts. i have skinnier legs and i didn't see a problem with them being too baggy there. the olive color was nice, very comfortable material.	1
Ok, received this in the mail yesterday and tried on this morning, i ordered the size 2 snd it is really big. i notice that the armhole sag and there is a lot of extra room everywhere. i am a 32d on the top so that is why i ordered the size 2, but i will return this and order the size 0 and i hope that will take care of the sagging arm area	1
"I so wanted to love this dress! the fabric is gorgeous the styling beautiful and the construction is great - however, the armholes are cut too generously. i am 5'4"", 138 pounds and 36d. i ordered the black in a size 10. it fit me perfectly everywhere but the armholes. even with an undergarment, too much is exposed. i am sadly returning this."	0
Dress is pretty, i was disappointed by the slip which is too small like previous customer. i am an inch taller than the model and i feel more comfortable it being a tunic with leggings. nice but not nice enough to keep, i am returning. :(	0
This sweater fits perfect and the pink trim makes it stunning! i was pleasantly surprised when i tried this on. i don't usually pay this much for a cardigan, but the quality and feel are better than usual.	1
I typically wear a small or x-small in most brands from retailer, but decided to order a small and medium in this dress since it's a non-stretchy fabric. i'm glad i did because the medium was a good fit and the small would have been very snug. so i would agree with the previous reviewer and say that this dress runs at least a size small. otherwise i really like the fit the fabric.	1
Skirt in med fit fine, cute,lightweight, swingy, flirty, fun, almost knee length i am typically a 10-12 but the pattern which swings up, across, and down made me look wide in the hips as opposed to other clothes i own already more petite, less curvy girls enjoy! its going back,sorry!	1
The fabric is super soft and the grey is pretty, but it is light grey not dark grey as described when you select to buy it. my biggest issue with the top is that the cold shoulder arm reveals the entire arm, so if you aren't completely toned with your tricep and all over arm, it will show... which is why i bought this to hide my blunders	1
I bought this dress to wear at a wedding. i am short, so i would have really loved the petite, but they were sold out both online and in store when i bought it. i'm making do with high heels. the sheen is gorgeous and the dress is very comfortable over all. i'd also add that i'm pretty curvy and the cut fits my body perfectly.	1
The idea of this shirt is awesome! it just needs to be made longer and not so boxy. the ruffle is darling! i would be so happy if the the designer made some modifications. i think a lot of people would buy it then.	0
"I adore this top. it is super soft, drapes nicely, and looks great with a ton of different bottoms. i am 5'4"", 104 lbs., and ordered this in both xs (my usual size), and s. i ended up keeping the s (most cloth & stone xs tops swim on me, so i was a little surprised), but glad i tried both. my only concern is how it will hold up after washing it. it is a gauze-like material, and i just hope i can get a long life out if this top."	1
This sweater is way cuter in person. the picture online does not really show the adorable contrast of the snails to the rest of the sweater. also, it looks like they photoshopped out the fact that the buttons run the whole length of the front. really cute and soft (not itchy). highly recommend	1
"This dress is really flattering on. fits true to size. perfect length, i'm 5'6"" & dress hits just a few inches above my knees. it's simple, yet versatile seasonally. right now i plan to wear it with booties & sandals in the spring."	1
The material and color of the dress were great, but the fit was rather blah. i don't think it was right for my shape. i am disappointed though, i liked design of it.	0
I picked this up during the bf promo and very happy to find my size 10. i was watching this coat, i call this really a topper, because it is not heavy and finishes an outfit, i went up to a size 10 because it runs slim as noted in the description and the reviews. i find this piece to be a reminder of the old retailer pieces i have collected over the years ( since 2001!) my chest is a 34dd and even then the 10 is snug. i can't wait to wear this bold statement piece, i purchased the bailly 44 navy p	1
In maeve i run between a size 2-4.  my regular size 4 was too tight in the shoulders, the fabric didn't drop off the shoulders like it does on the model.  it also felt too tight near the back were the button is, almost as if there was not enough fabric.  the sleeves were also too short and tight around the arms.  sized up to a 6 and all those issues were fixed.  since this top is billowy anyway the size up really didn't mess with the shape of the top.  love the gold color, so pretty!	1
Great dress. looking forward to wearing it with tights. fits great.	1
I bought this item in green and then ordered it in red. very comfortable fabric and flattering by itself or over leggings. these tunics will be staple in my closet. i normally wear a medium in retailer dresses, but i ordered a small to have it a bit more fitted instead of baggy. good decision!	1
"I really love this piece. it's so different from anything else i own! the material has a lot of fine details to it that are hard to see in the photos. easy to dress up with a bit of jewelry and heels. the only downside is the upper body fit. i'm 5'6"" and 130 lbs with more of an hourglass shape. i did not fill out the top at all, although the shorts fit fine around my waist."	1
"Love this top so much. it's very unique and one of those tops that's ""effortless"" to wear. i was expecting it to be boxy because of what other reviewers had written, but i find it to be flattering and comfortable. i'm glad i ordered the small because i do think the medium (my usual size) would have been too big."	1
This shirt is so soft and lovely, i will be wearing it a lot...after i make one little adjustment. i don't mind some cleavage, but the bottom of the slit in the middle of this shirt goes all the way down to my bra and i feel like i'm showing a lot of side boob...inner side boob?...cleavage? i don't know what the word is, but it definitely feels out of place in a professional setting. however, i'm going to sew a hook and eye onto the top of the slit so i can close it and it will be more like a ke	1
"I tried on this jumpsuit on a whim thinking it be a great throwback to the 70s. it is actually very flattering on, with the lines running down vertical, giving a slimming look to any figure. it is also very soft and comfortable on, and has nice, large pockets on the sides. it doesn't look dated at all once on, and i'm sure will get plenty of use as the weather warms up. for reference, i'm 5'7"" tall, and weigh close to 130 lbs., and found the small fit well. the only drawback was the pice, but i"	1
This just arrived and it looks exactly like the photo. very well made, crisp and lovely. not see thru at all which is a plus. a bit overpriced but going to keep it.	1
"I love this skirt! it is a lovely and soft gauze layer with lining underneath. i live where the summer""s are hot and humid and this skirt keeps me cool when everything else just sticks to me. it is, for sure, very limited because it does not have a zipper.... if you cannot get this over your hips or over your shoulders and bust, this is not the skirt for you. the elastic waistband is really strong and really highlights your waist, but yes, i am petite and i struggle to get it on. once it is on,"	1
I ordered this in xxs petite, and it fit nicely, the green color was nice, the cut was just above the knee, flattering, but not wow. it is nice if you need a casual dress to hang around, go to the beach, playground with kids, etc., but there were just better options for me. so i returned it. the size fit me well at 115 lbs, 30dd chest. i say go for it, if you need a nice soft casual dress, ok to size down.	1
"This shirt looks nice on the model, but it felt stiff and unflattering on me. i am 5'5"", 135lbs, 34c, and the size 4 fit overall. i just didn't happen to like it on me."	0
I bought this for my girlfriend with the hope that my presumptive intuition about her style preferences and the fit itself would prove successful. fortunately she loves it and looks amazing in it! the colors are vibrant and the unique texture really lends itself toward a clothing item that is special- even for retailer. recommend it highly!	1
This dress looked like something i would wear and covet for years. unfortunately it was loose in the places where it should show shape and was tight in others. the bodice is incredibly small and not meant for bigger chested women. while the fabric is beautiful, overall the dress did not look like much. disappointed.	0
This is a cute top that can transition easily from summer to fall. it fits well, nice print and it's comfortable. i tried this on in the store, but did not purchase it because the color washed me out. this is not the best color for a blonde. would look much better on a brunette. if this was in a different color i most likely would have purchased it.	1
I had hopes for this shirt but was disappointed in the fabric...it's very stiff and heavy for a summer blouse. will be returning it.	0
This is an adorable top that i find to be extremely comfortable. i don't usually buy prints but this one is so feminine and looks great with dark wash jeans. i am a 36d and the medium was a perfect fit.	1
I bought the xs and the fit was good. i'll probably add a snap at the bust area because the slip underneath does show like a camisole, which is fine, but i prefer it closed. also i'll add a belt to cinch my waist, booties and maybe a hat.	1
"I love this jumpsuit. i would like to first say that, while a gorgeous model, i actually think this piece looks even better on different body shapes!  sizing  i love the shape, the style, and the comfort. i tried it on in a dressing room where it turns out another woman was trying it as well. i am 5'5"" and usually wear a 4 or 6 and got the small. she was a bit shorter and pettte and it looked fabulous on her! it is loose all over, and so flow and fabulous. it hits me where it hits the mod"	1
I loved this top from first sight and finally bought it this week. i am usually a six or a small. the small was so tight on the top that the ruffle rolled up across my chest. i ended up with a medium.	1
I bought this dress for a fall wedding and upon receiving it was very impressed with the quality of lace and the color. however upon trying it on the seam up the back was slit so high that my undies were visible. i would like to assume that the dress that i received was defective... it didn't really make sense given that the length of the dress was appropriate, i did not have time for a return so i had the seam completed. after that alteration (on my own dime) i was very happy with the dress and	1
Disappointment city with this one and i am so lucky i had a coupon because if i would have paid the full $128 they are asking, i would be a tad skewed. not just thin material but thin and cheap feeling. doesn't itch but i seriously expected a lot more from retailer. i have noted the name of the designer and have promised myself to never buy this label again. big loser.	0
"I saw this online & wondered abt the sleeve length on me. i was thinking about ordering the petite size since i'm only 5'3"". sometimes cardigans have longer sleeves than i want. it was at the local store so i tried on the regular xs in the grey. the fit & sleeve length was fine. what i didn't care for was a slight itchiness (wool fiber) & some mild shedding (alpaca fiber). i decided against it but it is nice looking. 5""3"", 117#"	1
As most other reviewers stated, the skirt does run a bit large and long. however, it is nothing a tailor can't fix! i plan on getting it taken in to fit higher up on my waist to make it both smaller and hit closer to below my knees rather than mid-calf. the elegance of the skirt can be dressed up or down depending on what top/shoes you pair it with. it feels well made and the coloring is much better in person than in the picture!	1
Stylish or comfy - often the choice when looking for casual but not with this top! it's comfy and cozy and stylish to boot. the sleeves are fun and create a nice line of interest. you can pair this with jeans for a casual day or dress it up with slacks and heels and be comfy either way.	1
I was really excited that they decided to make these. i am a big fan of the tanks and wanted a long sleeve (or even short sleeve - hint!) version of them to wear under suits to work in the winter etc. these do the job nicely - bought ivory and black. other reviewer is right however, something strange in the shoulders as they are quite narrow and the fabric tends to bunch a bit and the arm length is a little strange. i am 5'8 and 150 lbs and order a medium in most retailer stuff and i tend to buy a	1
This dress is amazing. nice material, comfortable and really flattering. slightly tight in the arms but otherwise perfect. highly recommended!!!	1
I needed an outfit for my son's christening 10 weeks after he was born. one thing i have to keep in mind with purchasing items now is how well they work for easy breastfeeding. this jumpsuit was perfect 'dressed up' with a cropped tuxedo jacket, cute shoes and jewelry. i felt so chic and not only did it fit my new post-baby shape, but was awesome for nursing him when needed. i felt comfortable all day and look forward to 'dressing it down' for less formal occasions. the material is so soft and i	1
"I just received this dress and i love it. after reading the reviews i was worried that it would be too tight so i ordered both a 6 and an 8. i am 5'8"", hourglass, 135 lbs, and the 6 is just perfect. i love how it falls just below the knee, but the front slit gives it that little flirt factor. this is the go-to summer dress i had been looking for!"	1
"Many internet reviews note that byron lars dresses run large and suggest that women 5'5"" and under should size down and go petite. i am 5'3"" and 101 pounds and the 0 petite size was too snug across my back and too short when i sat down. when i stood up i had to pull the dress down, as it would bunch up around the hips. therefore, the size 2 regular ended up being a perfect fit, no alterations needed. i was searching for a dress for an upcoming wedding and for vacation and kept coming back to thi"	1
Great very flattering bohemian dress! and it's silk!	1
The dress is precious and looks good on all body types. however, the bust is extremely tight. i had to go up a dress size just to fit in the chest area.	1
I love the style, but it didn't work for me. i ordered the r size. they were way too too long. i generally wear size 26, and the r length works with most retailer pants. with this particular pant, i could barely pull up the zipper. i'm not sure what happened bc i haven't gained any additional weight. i am 5'2, and 110 lbs. unfortunately, i had to return the pants. i think the design is for supermodels. maybe a petite size would have worked? the p was out of stock. good luck!	0
I have still not decided if i am keeping this dress. i sized up according to the other reviews. i typically wear a 6, so i got an 8. it fit me just fine on top, but i am a 36b, so fairly small. because of the photos, i expected the dress to be a-line and flare out at the hips. it did not, that that's why i am unsure. i'd like it to flare out a little more than it does. it would be more flattering and more comfortable. i love the dress otherwise. i think i may take it to a tailor and see if there	1
Great for the beachy business look. classy, but immensely comfortable. i feel like i look sharp without having to sit poker-straight.	1
So i recommend wearing with something more fitted, or with a flare (jeans), or tucked in like the picture. i love the detail of hte polka dot on the sleeves and collar (inside), so if you leave the collar open or roll the sleeves up a bit, you see hte contrast. it is a bit short, and i am petite, i ended up with regular size anyway otherwise, it may have been too short. colors are nice, and i love the material, it is very soft and hoepfulyl warm (my orffice is freezing). should ahve grabbed it	1
The shirt was soft and very flattering on. got multiple compliments.	1
I read the previous comments and was skeptical. i love the dress! it's fitted on the top and flowy on the bottom. i didn't find it too big or maternity on the bottom half. the print is really pretty with flecks of blue that brightened up the dress.	1
This dress is very well made. the fabric is thick enough for winter weather and is great for work or a nice party. i do not think the arm openings are too large at all.	1
Really comfortable, great for casual event or everyday wearing. best style with jeans.	1
I ordered this top online in two colors, and kept the berry color. i liked it while trying it on. when i wore it an entire day, the top just didn't look that good. it wasn't flattering, and it focused on the bad areas despite being loose fitting. it didn't seem very flattering. i wore it for one day and am not happy with my purchase. i wish i could send it back but i already wore it. the fit just isn't very flattering. it is loose but focuses on the curves not in a good way if you are curvy.	0
The picture doesn't do this justice. this top is amazing in person. i purchased my regular size 2. it is very versatile and the colors are perfect as well as cut and material. worth the money	1
I really didn't expect to like these pants as much as i do. i ordered a pair of the pilcro linen wide legs and really loved the cute added lace details on them. i thought i would exchange these for another pair of those, but after trying both pairs on, i realized how much softer and heavier these are. i will keep the one pair of the pilcro, but they did feel a little scratchy. these have a very nice drape to them and they do make your bum look nice. i ordered a size 8, which is what i seem to we	1
Well made garment. i love the colors, fabric and flounce at the bottom. the top is a little large on top with large armholes, but at least it will be cool on a hot summer day.	1
I am always a fan of retailer cardigans, but this one exceeded my expectations. the quality is a work of art, especially the back and the color, i chose the green, is so unique and beautiful. you will not be disappointed, go for it!	1
I recommend with reservations. these leggings are 100% wool, soft, not itchy, light weight, lovely knitted pattern. they run large. i sized down to a small. the first time i wore them they were fine. but the second time the waist stretched out and was useless: they were falling down as i walked. such a shame because everything else about them is perfect for cold winter days. they even fit under my silk skirt and would make other lighter garments wearable in winter. so what to do? at the price th	1
I did buy these when they were 40% off the sale price. well worth it. they are comfortable, thick but not too warm. they are my 'nice' home pants to wear outside. =) i love them. i got a large and they fit on the baggy side but not bad. i'm usually a large or xl.	1
I just received this in the mail today and haven't taken it off since! i feel like i should be in a romantic movie with a cute black dress under it. can definitely see myself getting a lot of use out of it. can not wait to wear it for the holidays!	1
"I recently purchased this dress in the yellow, which is not advertised online, but glad i saw at the store because the color is vibrant but not too loud and really compliments my olive skin. the dress ran a little on the larger side so i had to size down. also, you will have to either wear a strapless bra or go without because you cant hide bra straps as this is more of a halter look. i'm 5'9"" and the length was perfect for me, will be able to wear with heels or flats."	1
Why does the lining stop at mid thigh when the skirt is long? makes product look cheap while wearing. love the color, the fabric, and the fit, but cant get past this less than quality feature - will be returning.	0
Like the reviewers before me, this dress runs small in the rib cage. i normally take a 12 and am a 32b. the max size that this dress comes in is a 12 so i could only order a 12. it just fit but that is because i am a smaller 12 on the top. there is no wiggle room in the dress.  that being said, it is a really cute style and shape - rather like a 50's style dress if you will with a sexy back. i am curvy on the bottom and this dress hides the flaws there for sure. however, because it is a fulle	1
I love the idea of this top.  i had reservations when i ordered it d/t the large armholes but i envisioned wearing my cute cropped pilcro jean jacket with it.  it turned out to be a disappointment.  the armholes are gigantic and the sweater itself did not fit as on the model.  the front was much shorter and wider and basically stuck out from my body.  for reference, i ordered the xxsp.  sizing up might have lengthened the front but would have exacerbated the armhole problem.	0
Love this color! when i saw this beautiful blue color in the store i had to try them on! so pretty! if you love pilcro chinos--you will be happy with these! same great fit and an awesome color!	1
This really is a gorgeous jacket! i would give it 4.5 stars just because sometimes it can be a bit unflattering in the tummy area (poofs out a bit) at certain times, but i had to remind myself that is the style of the coat. i am petite and curvy on bottom, so this could just be me. tried wearing with a skinny belt and it looked cute, i think i will try both ways. seems very warm. beautful colors and the material is soft and not itchy at all! excited because versatile for everyday wear but also l	1
This is a nice shirt and very flattering. the ivory is actually more of a tan/brown- i would not call it ivory or off white. the material has a nice texture to it as well. it does run big and long so keep that in mind when purchasing.	1
This cardigan/sweater/jacket is splendidly soft, wonderfully warm and super stylish. i wear it with a navy pencil skirt or leggings. this piece will be timeless.	1
I got the green one. as the other reviewers commented, yes, the fabric is thin. however, i wear it with a nude bra and a nude cami and i've had nothing but compliments!	1
I bought this item from online... the fit on the model looked a little loose but when i got mine it seemed a bit tight! so i took it back to the store & ordered a larger size. for the sale price this is a great top.	1
This dress really was huge, and not at all flattering. i don't know how they got it to look good on the model in the picture. material was nice and soft, but i really don't see how anyone could look good in this, no matter what your body shape is.	0
I can't wait to wear this,but it has been to hot in the south.you can wear this so many ways.the material is wonderful, and the pattern better in person.	1
They look nice on the page, but they didn't work on my body. made me look big and boxy. maybe if you're super-skinny, they'll be fine.	0
Love this top! wore with jeans, comes to about mid hip so good coverage. fit was perfect for me!	1
I wish i would have read the other reviews before ordering. it's cute, but very casual and very thin material...not like other retailer tops. also runs super small. i ordered a small (i wear a small or xsmall at retailer) and will likely jump to a large given feedback in other reviews.	1
I bought this in a beautiful cornflower blue at my retailer store. i don't see that color for sale online. the blue material was not thin or see through, but perhaps the white is. the fit is very structured, which helps me cover my mom belly. i have never said this before, but i think it looks better on me than it does on the model wearing white. on sale, i got this for about $20. i got it for a steal. i like the different directions of line patterns and the length is nice too. one thing you can't	1
I took advantage of the sale this weekend & purchased this super cute vest yesterday which made it a more justifiable purchase. it's so soft, fits tts & i just can't wait for cooler weather so i can start wearing it!	1
This is a beautiful blouse but it's gigantic. my bra size is 34d and i was swimming in a 2. the bust measured 42 inches at it's widest point. you can see the model is camouflaging the volume by holding her arms to the side. the fabric is pulled in an unatural way so the top is probably pinned for the photo. if you want this look go down 2 sizes. that much fabric is just not flattering on me so i am returning to the store. i'm passing on the 0 because the thin fabric seems like it will seriously	1
I ordered my usual size; however when it arrived it appeared to fit a 9 year old! the color and style are adorable. i will need to exchange it for 2 sizes larger! i am so shocked at maeve's sizing.	0
I loved the look and style of the dress but was unsure how it would work with my body. i'm curvy but slim and usually a size 6 or 8 in retailer. i went with the m in the navy color, and i'm happy i did!  the floral pattern is vibrant and the ruffled skirt is flirty and fun. as far as fit goes, i'd say this runs mostly true to size but is rather short in length. i have a large chest so the top part looked more baggy than blousy, and the skirt portion was just comfortably fitted. however, the cuten	1
"Great dress in terms of material, quality, print...something about the weight with the lining made it not work for me. i ordered one size down as recommended by other reviewers, but that didn't work; there was too much fabric for the length and the lining made it look heavier. i ordered a medium and i""m 5'5"" on the curvy side. oh well. i've had so much luck with other retailer orders so i'm not too disappointed."	1
I love this top...i waited for it to go on sale, and it was well worth it. it has a peplum bottom and it is slightly longer in the back. i found it to be true to size but if you are going to but reaching up, the arms do run a little tight. overall, the mock neck, button closure on the back, and the feminine flare of this top create a beautiful classic look	1
Cute. i love the button back detail. but it's completely see-through. i could have worked with that by putting a cami underneath, but the arm holes were too tight. didn't look bad, just felt uncomfortable. you can't really tell in the pic, but there's elastic on the arm holes. it'll work if you have super skinny arms, but apparently i don't.	1
Beautiful,delicate and unique cotton blouse that accentuates the waist and falls nicely down the belly. i love the floral print, very appropriate for spring/summer. i agree with the other reviewers who've mentioned that it runs small. i have a bust size of 34 dd and waist size 25 and i had to size up to 12. nevertheless, i am really looking forward to wearing this with a pair of skinny jeans and some nude pumps for a girls night out.	1
"Light weight and cotton, great summer top. runs a little big but it suits me. i'm short and find the straps a drop loose because they're a fixed length meant for someone a little taller than 5'1"" me, but they are not falling down so far. also, if you look at the photo of the model wearing the top in black, you can see through the lace to the bra underneath. if you just wear a bra the same color as the top it's not at all noticeable. great piece for summer."	1
The material was thin, showed every lump you'd rather hide and clung to the body. even the sleeves were tight. looked inexpensive.	0
I really liked the style of this dress. the top was nice and stretchy and the bottom is so soft and silky. i love lace and thought that was a nice detail for the top. the colors are a little brighter in person, the red in the pictures here is more of a hot pink in person. i'm planning on buying some hot pink flats to wear with it at a wedding this summer!  one reviewer said she didn't like the placement where the dress fell, i have a short torso and long legs, so i like to try to emphasize a	1
Love love love this skirt. i walked into retailer in august not looking to buy this skirt even though i saw it in the catalog and thought it was cute. once i tried it on i fell in love. i purchased both black and blue. super flattering and true to size. its a must have for sure.	1
I purchased this dress to wear to a horse race but will also be wearing it all summer long! the material is light weight and has a vintage flare to the print. the button in the center of the dress add an extra detail that keeps the dress pretty and casual.	1
I originally got this for myself but it was just a little bit more snug than i liked. i ended up giving it to my daughter. it fits her nicely and she wore it to her holiday party at work and it was a hit!!	1
I ordered a medium and it fit perfectly. i am anywhere from a size 6-8. 5'9, 155lbs. sadly, i am returning this dress because the horizontal stripes make my hips look huge.	1
Surprised that this is a fall/winter dress. the embroidery is beautiful but the material isn't that thick and the tie at the waist is unusual. would have been better if rather than having the tie built into the dress it was separate.	1
This is a beautiful blouse however it runs big. i order the small and had to return it. my measurements are 5'4 135 34c-28-38 for reference. you will not regret buying this blouse but it has to be the right size if not it would look like it did on me, frumpy. i kept taking it off and putting it back on trying to make it work (because i liked the material that much) but if you look at the model she has her arms straight down. when i lifted my arms i had 3 inches of extra material on both side. th	1
I love this dress! i ordered a petite size and just love how it fits. i would highly recommend this dress, too cute!	1
Great dress.  fitted but flowing.  i like the colors and think it will easily grams iron to fall.  i am 5 ft 32 d 27 waist.	1
Love the coat. style and fit are a perfect fit. true to size. thanks for the previous reviews about the button. i am extra careful taking it on and off. versatile. take the collar off and wear on a sweater or whatever inspires you.	1
I'm a sucker for beaded detailing, so i couldn't resist this blouse. it's so beautiful and fun! i can't wait to wear it!	1
Lush eye catching print. saw it, tried it on and had to have it, full price or not. very comfortable. bought one size down and it fit perfectly.	1
I agree with other reviews, soft, cozy and love the embroidery and beading. it is a bit wrinkly even after i ironed it but overall happy with this blouse.	1
Purchased this fun, feminine top right before vacation and wanted to wear it every single day. the peplum style isn't typically something i gravitate to, but this peplum is the perfect length and i love the sheer 3/4 length sleeves. i chose the ivory version of this top and it was adorable with jeans, oxfords & a cute hat. for how beautiful this top is, i feel like the price tag is an absolute steal!	1
Soft, very thin material. perfect for summer but very difficult to wear without a bra because it is so thin it shows quite a bit. the chest is tight but you can adjust the fit by the neck tie. looks exactly like on the model but the cut made me feel wide. had to take it back.	0
"This skirt looks very nice in person and it hugs one's cure beautifully. the hem is uneven which makes it more interesting. i am 5'2"", 120lbs, tried it in the navy/beige color in size s and size xs, and i found size xs fits better. the fabric is soft and stretchy, and it drapes well. because i am petite, the length of the normal size fits me more like a maxi skirt (it goes all the way down to my mid calf). unfortunately, the petite xs is sold out, so i have to settle with the normal size xs. sti"	1
Great material. quality and versatility is there. it is easy to get in and out of which is hard to find and the fit is adjustable at the waist.	1
I love this dress! splurged while i was doing my christmas shopping to get this for myself, and i'm so glad i did! it's such a comfortable dress - stretchy and not too thin or too heavy of a fabric. it pairs well with tights and a long cardigan in the winter, or on it's own with a statement necklace. style and fit are great - this dress is super flattering,	1
"I had this on my wish list but saw it as a "" on of"" on black friday....and it just happened to be my sisz p it fit me perfect... if anything it runs a little big but it is great to layer. it can be worn sipped over a cami with lace showing .... or as a regular cardi/jacket over first layer! the detailing is loely! even tho it is 40% off today ( i got it with the 25% off store wide sale), my size sold out before this promo so i am very glad i got it when i did. just in time for all the christmas"	1
This jacket is really cute! however, the mesh is really fragile. i've had the jacket for a month and noticed a huge tear down the back shoulder. it doesn't fit me tight so i'm not sure how it happened. every time i wear it i'm super paranoid about snagging it on something. like i mentioned before, the jacket is cute. it's lightweight and the design is unique. but if you want to get more than an occasional wearing out of this then don't bother. i'm hoping i can return it otherwise that's a lot of	0
This dress was ok - i thought the fabric was soft, but not my favorite. it's a pull on dress that would be easy to dress up or down. but, i have bigger hips and this dress was really not flattering on my - would be better on a different body type.	0
I try to find something to like about everything i buy, even if it turns out to be a disappointment. for me the neckline of this shirt is absolutely beautiful and super flattering. it was one of the only things that made me want to keep the shirt, but unfortunately it was not enough. this shirt is super boxy and runs large. i would recommend sizing down for those who want to try this. if you have a larger chest it might be worth ordering your regular size so that the buttons won't pull at the ch	0
Yay hei hei! love these pants. thanks to the roll-up, they show a nice bit of ankle. lightweight but sturdy?i've been reaching for them when it just seems too hot for jeans. they're a little poufy toward the top (below the waist), but the tie waist makes them sufficiently cinchable. i expect to get a lot of wear out of these this summer. i did experience some stretching/sagging after a full day of walking, moving, and sitting, so i bought my second pair in m instead of l. (got navy and went back	1
"Love the look of this poncho - which is not as large/billowy as i thought it would be. i tried it on as a whim in the store and fell in love. the colors are more beige than gray, for those of you with pale/blue underdone complexions. it may wash you out. love the orange knit running through to give it a little pop. i'm 5'9""/132 pounds, and the hem was a bit cropped on me. may want to consider a tank top or t-shirt underneath."	1
I was worried this sweater would be too tight, but it has a very flattering fit. i am a librarian and this sweater makes me feel like a quirky librarian. i love it!	1
The peplum for this time hit me in the middle of my rib cage, not at my natural waist, so it looked very odd when it flared out with the peplum so high up. i am busty so it's possible this would not be the case for everyone but i generally can wear peplum tops with no problem. i was disappointed to return it, the fabric was very nice and the concept behind the shirt was a good one.	0
I ordered a size small (usually i am ps) but wanted the extra length. usually i can get away with a regular small but not this time. such a cute style but made me look short & wide. unfortunately it's going back	0
Disappointed this didn't fit better. the pockets stuck out on the sides, and it was baggy through the middle. you could also see the pockets through the outer layer of the dress. the color is more like a chartreuse than the picture. it's really pretty!	1
I was taking my time with this purchase i needed a top for a pair of ombrã© silk pants that i had tailored to fit. but everytime i put these pants on i couldn't find any top to come close to match..especially since the pants are for a more sophisticated look. well this top fits that perfectly and i'm excited to pair them for a nice dinner out. plus i was equally excited when i could pair the top with my jeans and sandals.	1
I really thought from the picture that the dress would be more fit for a curvy figure. it is, unfortunately, more well suited to those women with straighter lines. the color was more flat than the picture as well, but i bet it is lovely in navy.	0
This pullover is great for lounging! so warm and cozy!	1
"I got the small; 5'7"" 150 lbs,pear shaped. fit was a little sung,mainly due to the lining.i wore it once already- super cute.i washed it in cold and line dried it as i was afraid of shrinkage.i thought about getting a medium but all sizes except xs are sold out. i must be careful not to gain any more weight,otherwise the dress won't fit me anymore!"	1
I'm a 34c and 136 lbs. i bought this in m in two colors because i love it so much! the fit is so flattering and the material is so soft and comfortable. i continue to get the best quality and fitting dresses from retailer!	1
Do not waste your money on this. at first, i bought pilcro hyphen chinos short and i loved it. so i bought this pants in store too. i laundry them yesterday and they both came out colorless. i was so shock.  fyi, i did not use bleach or chrolox, i mean i don''t use them.i will return them both. still mad. this is bad quality enough worth it.	0
I thought this top was absolutely beautiful! i couldn't wait to get it in but unfortunately it was very big on me. (i'm 5 ft, 105 lbs and got the pxs) the arm holes were so big as well as the overall fit. i'm very disappointed, i really wanted this top to work.	0
I'm short, only 5ft and this is beautiful and flowy. it's just below my knees and i think it's perfect. i have only worn it twice out and literally everywhere i went i received a compliment, and asking where i got it. it's unique and no one else carries one like this. i know some customers mentioned the price being a bit high but i disagree. i would rather pay for something that i love, that has good design and quality instead of 50 or 60 for a so so product. that's what i love about retailerpolog	1
In the midst of the end-of-winter doldrums, i tried this cute top on. springy. powdery. happy. the lace is soft, not too stiff or scratchy, and lightweight enough to transition nicely into summer. because the cami is a separate piece, i also envision wearing this as a top over a slip-dress with some retro mary janes. the sleeve length makes it fair game for late winter, too. yay!	1
Very nice sweater, surprisingly just as pictured color-wise, i ordered a large and it felt true to size in the shoulders, but this sweater flair out to the bottom, you can kind of see it in the photo, the length is good as well for a regular fit. it's very unique combination of fabric acrylic/wool knit, the texture is really nice and soft and looks very good on. also it's thick and warm. i wore the top to work today on 34 degree weather and received many compliments. sweater looks simple but the	1
"This jacket doesn't look all that special in the photos provided. i found it at my local store and i knew it was mine the moment i tried it on. it has that boxy shoulder look i associate with 80s power suits. i call this look: ""full sigourney weaver"" and it is marvelous! perfect for a lunch date with harrison ford circa 1988. so happy with this purchase. highly recommend!"	1
Super cute, soft, and fuzzy...just like the woodland animals in the pattern. these loungers do run just slightly tight in the seat, so if you have a more developed bottom you should definitely get a size up.	1
This dress didn't work for me at all. i'm 6ft tall, 160lb, i usually wear size l 8/10, but based on the reviews i ordered an m. the material of this dress is very soft and fuzzy, color is about the same as pictured, also length is appropriate. dress is very thick and warm, the fabric however has no stretch at all, dress is very specious and shapeless. there is allot of room everywhere except shoulders & sleeves, i thought that area was tight & snug which is strange because it runs large everywhe	0
"As soon as i saw this dress, i knew i had to have it. i just tried it on and it is beautiful. i feel gorgeous and glamorous! i can't wait to wear this to a special event as it truly deserves that attention. the silk is soft and the slip underneath is perfect. the tie in the back perfectly cinches the dress and the pleating is a wonderful detail to the look. i am 5'0"", 110, and i purchased the small petite. it's slightly big around the armholes and it kind of poofs / puckers out so i'm going to"	1
This is all around, a pretty feminine take on the white shirt- very cute! the dot pattern adds some drama without it being too over-board. this fit of this top is fairly generous (on me at least), but it doesn't have a lot of stretch. i could probably be either a s or xs, but took the xs to get more of a silhouette.	1
"Ok, so to be honest i just bought these two days ago so as far as wear and tear i'll have to get back to you on that but i seriously think i will just live in these. first they are so so comfortable, soft material, stretchy but not so thin that they accentuate every little curve but also very flattering. i'm 5'4"" 127 lbs, curvy in the bottom with a smallish waist and purchased size 28. there is a little bit of room, which i'm happy with, so they don't squeeze the love handle area or make it unco"	1
"Though i am a true size medium, i do not like fitted tees, so generally i buy a large. based upon other reviews, i decided to give the medium a try, hoping that it would be loose enough. though i am on the cusp of petite (5' 3 1/2""), i decided to go with the regular medium since i prefer longer, tunic length tops. the medium does run big, imo, and fits me like a large would. it is loose, flowy and long enough to cover my entire backside. the sleeves are long and i do have to roll them up, perhap"	1
The print and detail on this dress are so much better in person, especially the neckline! i agree with the previous reviewer in that it felt spring-timey to me. flattering fit and flare however the top runs extremely small. i am usually a 6 in retailer dresses and i could barely zip the 8 over my bust but the 10 was enormous. rest of the dress fit fine but if you are large up top you might want to size up. fabric does not stretch. overall too cute to pass up! for reference i am a 34dd.	1
"Like the other reviewers, i agree that this sweater is waaaay shorter than it looks on the model. i think she's wearing a large size and it's probably cinched in the back. still cute, though! i'm 5'9"" 145 and a medium fits well -- looks cute with high-waisted jeans (which i wear anyway)."	1
I coveted this blouse for weeks and finally pressed go during the recent sale. it is truly lovely - the textured silk and its lining combine to give this blouse the weight it needs to flow perfectly when untucked. it is a-shaped and fuller at the hem. when tucked, it is neat as a pin. the colors are almost metallic and it looks as if the flowers have been painted on. this is an elegant casual look with white jeans and heels, or i've dressed it up with a black pencil as well as a skirt almost ide	1
This top is fun. loose but still flattering. the colors are nice and the fabric soft. can fit well. (115lbs 30 dd)	1
I ordered the petite in my size, since i'm well petite, but curvy. i recommend this dress if you don't have a lot of boobage. unfortunately, for me the waist line came up high an inch below my bra line and made the dress poof out at my hips in an unflattering way. its so pretty and i was really excited about ordering it. it fits, but just is not flattering because of my boobs. this is always my problem though with dresses.	1
Didn't even wait for a sale on this top! so adorable and fits great. i bought a medium and wear a small in most things. i like that it is a touch big as it hangs better that way.	1
For cat lovers in particular, these socks will grab your attention. they are fine quality ankle socks. the kittens are really more moss green than beige.	1
This dress had an odd fit. very loose on top with pointy darts, very tight on bottom. fabric was stiff so it didn't move well with me	0
Love this cardigan. the quality is beautiful and and comfortable. i think the cable stitching and pockets add such a unique touch.	1
What a perfect summer dress! after reading the previous review i ordered a size up and it's perfect. the slip is a little snug on the hips, but most dresses are on me so i think on most people it would fit very well as long as you ordered one size larger. i can't wait to wear this while traveling through europe next summer!	1
It's stunning in person. delicate beading detail on bodice isn't visible in the photo but really dresses it up. fits lovely but runs small. i am usually a 6 or 8, ordered the 8 and it just fits. fully lined. bought it to attend a wedding and i'm very pleased with it.	1
This top is good quality and cute. it runs large- i'm usually a medium and needed a small. the reason i will be returning it is because it flares out at the bottom on the black which is very unflattering on. it makes me look wide in the waist or like i'm wearing a maternity top. unfortunate because i really liked everything else about it.	0
"I must say that at first i had mixed feelings about this sweater. i was actually going to return it because i was unsure about the style and color. the color is to me like a lavender mauv-ish color but the description is actually ""natural"" . i must admit that in some light it looks more brown then lavender . regardless i think that in itself tells you that this sweater is not like any other. i actually wear it as a coat and its become an essential part of my wardrobe. i found the size to be true"	1
Beautifully detailed top that pairs well with dark denim. top is a bit wide, but i think that is the style. a unique and different piece to add to your wardrobe!	1
It is beautiful, but not practical for me - the student who carries a backpack ! i didn't notice it doesn't have sleeves, it is regular poncho, soft and stylish . recommended for poncho lovers !	1
"I liked everything about this tunic except the way that it looked on me. the fabric was great - not too heavy, not too light. the design was cute and i loved the colors (i got the yellow). it was cut well, and a good length for me (i am 5'2""). that being said, i am curvy and i felt like i looked even rounder in this top. if i was 6-8"" taller it probably would have been perfect."	1
I bought these on sale for a great price online without seeing in person and was pleased to find that they are very versatile, could be very casual or great for weekend shopping, etc . the purple is a great shade and the fit is great. i'm 135 pound for reference and i purchased the size 28.	1
"This came in the mail today. i wasn't sure of my size, so i ordered a s & m. i tried on the small first and it fit perfect. i never tried on the medium. fyi, i'm 5'5"", 125 lbs., & 34a in the chest. this jacket is a keeper. it is so soft & comfortable on; i love olive as it goes with everything; it can be super casual or dressier depending upon what you're wearing. i also like that it is collarless as that better allows for a wrapped scarf. i will use this jacket a lot."	1
The color and fit of this dress is fabulous. i can't wait to wear it out.. casual with flats or dressy with heels. love it!	1
Not in love with this one. the fabric is thin and seems cheap... it seems overpriced even on sale. and it runs a bit small along the bust. i could maybe get away with it without a bra, but after 3 kids, braless isn't my best look. and i don't think the print is a pretty in person as it is online - can't quite put my finger on why... maybe a little darker in person. that said, the fit is flattering. the cinched waist is lovely, and the skirt is nice and flowy. even so, this one is going back.	0
So wanted great pair of sweater leggings...great for running errands and keeping the outfit simple. these are not that. these fit very poorly...i ordered the small, which is more like a large one in the waistline...there is nothing to hold these up and i could fit two of me in them. unfortunately, i thought all would be fine and i discarded the receipt and have worn them a few times~	0
This shirt has a vibrant color and beautiful neck line, but unfortunately i had to send it back. it is short waisted with a lot of material in the back. had it been 1-2 inches longer it may flare out, but based on the length on me, it ended up looking like a shrunken tent. for reference, i am 5'8 with a long torso.	0
"I'm 5'5"" 127lbs. ordered size small. not sheer. bodysuit snaps. great to wear with skirts and wide leg pants!!"	1
This dress is one of the most beautiful dresses i have seen. purchased for my daughter . . . it was as if you made this dress for her. had to return it because the woven fabric was fraying around the back v neckline and zipper. was able to replace it, the replacement looks good -- have a concern about two areas but we will see. just love the lines and fit of this dress! truly hope the fabric holds up.	1
I have to agree with previous reviewers in that it is a bit short on the top but i kind of like that as i am petite and most tops come way too long on me; however go up a size if you have any breasts at all. likely they will not fit in you standard size. however i just love this shirt. soooo adorable. the color is a bit more olive than brown to me though than what is in the pic :)	1
I admit, i did not intend to buy a jean-dress but the cut - i could not pass it up. classic and vintage dress style. the fringy hem and more conservative length is so fun and makes the strapless top stand out. with a stunning necklace this will be a versatile piece. no doubt.	1
"I bought the red motiff in my usual size of xxs petite and it was huge. at first i thought they had mistakenly sent the wrong size but this was sadly not the case. the fit is definitely ""sack-like"" as other reviewers mentioned. i had to return."	0
I love the look and feel of these shorts - typically my issue with any sort of cotton or linen shorts these days is that they're practically made of nothing, but these are comfortable and made of decent fabric. however, they run very large. being 100 lbs and about 5', i typically buy size 0 or xs, but these looked a bit ridiculous on me, with how big they are. i tried shrinking them in the wash, since they're 100% cotton, and that helped some, along with getting rid of the creases from shipping	1
"The quality of he fabric is amazing. the thickness is perfect as to look form fitting while not too tight or thin showing any ""wrinkles."" i had been searching for a versatile turtleneck i could dress up or down a finding this was a definite win! the style is timeless and with the high quality i know this will be a staple for years to come."	1
"I am so happy i splurged and bought these jeans. based on the other reviewer, i ordered one size up, and they fit perfectly. i'm 5'8 and appreciate the longer inseam. i can't wear a wedge heel or anything with them, but with a flat on they skim the floor perfectly. you'll love the raw hemline and the subtle ""wear"" throughout the fabric. it's not overdone. just like in the picture, they really seem to narrow the hip, think page boy style. very, very flattering!"	1
Love this shirt, can dress up or more casual. wish i would of purchased all colors!	1
Like the other reviewer said, there's a nice inner lining, and the material of the jacket is just so nice. looks a little like a blazer when worn, but the heather gray makes it a dress up or down sort of piece.	1
"This dress is beautiful and very flattering! i bought the 8 and am 5'3"" and 138lbs. it fits right at the knee and is flowy, but still gives some shape without looking baggy. i love it!"	1
I was so excited to try this on after having discovered it on the retailer app and stepping into the store and seeing it. on the hanger it looked alright, but once i slipped it on, it's like everything i've got going for me disappeared. granted, i'm s little bottom heavy, so these types of dresses don't typically flatter my body type anyways.	0
"I love these pants. i vary between 10 & 12, the 10 fit perfectly since they are designed on the fuller size, perfect for my body type of small waist and a bit of bottom. so many colors to coordinate with these pants. teal green, ""retailer"" yellow, black...i am not fond of ankle pants, prefer longer pants. i took the cuffs down and lengthened the pants. the only problem is that these pants are so exquisitely made, removing the cuff tacks was a challenge! perfect pants for those of us who have shape"	1
I recently got this on sale after looking at it forever on my wish list. i'm so happy with it. its very comfortable and just long enough for my torso (5'3). the pattern on the front is very flattering.	1
"I love ag jeans. i own several pair, and i think they wash well, and wear well. that being said, i'd never purchased a pair of the ""stevie"" cut before. they have the same quality one would expect from ag, and i like that the ankles aren't true skinny jeans, but have a little width. it's more on-trend for this season. for me, the issue was more with the color. i order pink. when they arrived, they were beautiful in the little plastic bag. my heart skipped a beat. hooray! cute new jeans! except, w"	1
I love these pants! beautiful quality material, soft on the skin. fits well. definitely a tailored fit. true to size. unique design, and really fun! i am 5 foot 5, and weigh 132 lbs. i am apple shaped, so i was worried these would be too tight around the hips, but they aren't .	1
I thought from the picture this would be a light floaty top. when it arrived, the fabric was a heavy knit and the neckline sagged very low. on me (granted i'm a pear) the bottom layer hugged my tummy and rear in a very unflattering way. the only thing i liked was the color. back it went.	0
A great basic t, so very much cuter than most. i have black and white both and wish it came in more colors.	1
I just got this today & love it. the embroidery on the front is gorgeous & rich looking. the material is soft & has a nice weight so that it drapes perfectly & is not at all see through. it will look great with sandals, flats or sandals with heels. i wear an xs & it fits tts. it falls just above the knee. i can see me wearing this a lot. i was worried about it looking too youthfull for my age, but it doesn't at all.	1
I love these jeans! i am always reluctant to change brands, but these are the best! i was pleased from the minute i took them out of the package. the fit is perfect: very skinny, but not too tight! they retain their shape over several wearings, too. the color is a great dark navy. looking forward to a long relationship with these! it's love!	1
I could live in this top: it's versatile enough to be dressed up or down or worn as a bottom layer; the color offerings are basic enough to match anything; and it's comfortable enough to wear around the clock. note that it runs small. i had to size up to a medium, even though 80% of everything else i wear is size small.	1
I'm glad i bought this dress with a discount. it's a comfortable staple, but not a showstopper. i love the plush fabric, which has great weight, and the skirt. the top is cut to be a little revealing, which worked well with my full bust but wouldn't be work appropriate. the keyhole at the back is large, but did not reveal my bra.	1
I like the way the skirt of the dress swings when you move. in order to get the arm holes to not be too low, i ended up with the smaller of the two sizes i usually buy. i also appreciate the dress has pockets and the soft fabric. the tag says you can machine wash cold gentle which is also a plus!	1
Wore with leggings & ballet flats ??compliments!	1
For years i've eyed these printed pilcro cord leggings. every single year in every single incredibly cool print - i've always wanted them. finally i decided to try them on after we got this green and navy print, and i'm so glad i did. these are dreamy! they are so stretchy and so comfortable! they hold snug against your leg for a very streamlined fit, but plenty of stretch so movement is no issue. the print is my favorite part. the colors are extremely fun, but still classy enough to not feel to	1
Love love love!!! it is a little boxy but it is soo soft and comfortable!! it does run at least a size or 2 big!! i picked it up in the pink color yesterday at me local retailer store. was not sure about it when i first saw it online but fell in love with it quickly when i tried it on!!  great sweater for fall/winter	1
I wore this tee under a comfy cardigan on a flight to denver. i received several compliments.	1
I bought this in white at my local store. great staple to wear in the heat of the summer or as a layering piece. i bought my normal size medium and it fits loose and flowy. i wore a nude racer back bra and felt comfortable without a cami. great basic addition to my closet.	1
I bought this cuz i wanted a plaid shirt that didnt have too much plaid..this is true to size and adorable! i will be wearing it out and not to bed or for lounge. adorable detailing on back and on shoulders...its a keeper!	1
I remember the first time i walked into an retailer store: like walking into a dream of all my favorite things. i've finally found a store whose products help me to express myself. as a writer, i love whimsical & out of the ordinary. i have found my honey hole. every time one of the pastel bags w/ribbon handles is past over the counter or i push 'add to cart' on my computer, i do a little happy dance in my heart. my closet is like a candy store filled with sweets & treats. thank you retailerp	1
It feels weightless and is so feminine. great for layering or on its own. so happy i purchased it - know i will get tons of use out of it.	1
"I bought this skirt for an end of summer ""caribbean"" party. the floral detail is even more fun in person. it looks great with a red top or black tank."	1
Was looking for a layering tunic and this does the job. it's very long and i'm 5'11 and this covers to my mid thigh. the arms are very tight but stretched after a while and the material is thin. i like the button details and the olive color are a nice break from black and white. white might be see-through.	1
"This is a pretty dress, but the cut is quite boxy. i had thought that the dress would cut in a bit along the body and then ""flare out"" more around the waist down to the hem; however, the dress is baggy from the sleeves all the way down, which lends to a rather unflattering look."	0
I ordered this in the darker color. i was excited to try it on when it arrived the fabric was really nice, good quality and the design is so cute. sadly it did not work for me. there is a lot of volume especially in the back which does not work for my curvy shape. i can see this top working well on a straighter figure but the volume and length really just did not flatter my hips and thighs. i will be sending this back.	1
Thin and soft. lays nicely... form-fitting, but with enough fabric to move around and scrunch up without looking tight. the double-v makes it shift downward so the cut in front is pretty low - i have to keep adjusting it so it doesn't show too much. not sure how it'll hold up after a couple washes because the fabric is so lightweight.	1
I fell in love with this blouse the minute i saw it in the store. the colors are a little deeper than how they appear in the catalog, but the greens and browns are beautiful and will be great for fall! it fit very true to size, i usually wear 8-10, and the m fit perfect. the gold beading on the sleeves and neck are a nice extra! love this top!!	1
The blue color is beautiful and what attracted me to this sweater. the draped front is very flattering and the fit is true to size. unfortunately the banded hem creates a pouching effect that is very unflattering. i really wanted to love this sweater, but just can't figure out how to wear it without poofing. i think this is the reason it is tucked in in many of the model shots. it is still a pretty sweater and it may work with for some.	1
This coat is fun, flirty, & flattering. i bought it strictly for how good it looks on - it's not a coat for warmth. the top is tailored and fitted, but the bottom is very full and swings. (there is a lot of fabric on the bottom). i'm not sure why some people had a hard time with the sleeves - i do not have the smallest arms and this was not an issue for me. however, i had a very thin shirt underneath the coat and that is all you can fit under it, so keep that in mind. the small fit me perfect. v	1
"Quality of this dress is excellent! i ordered it in blue and the color looks exactly as it does online and the fit is exactly as it looks on the model. i am 5'4"" , 120 lbs, with an athletic build and ordered a small."	1
"I am a jumpsuit convert. i tried it on ""just in case,"" but was amazed at how easy and effortlessly adorable it is. i purchased the black, petite 4, and love that it is super versatile in terms of seasonality and styling options. i have an hourglass figure and the draping and fit of the piece work very well."	1
Wonderful, slimming leggings. snappy and a great accessory for any professional outfit.	1
"I was so excited for this dress.. but sadly it did not meet expectations. the gauze fabric already had several snags/pullers in it. the underslip was very short and just cleared my derriere.(i'm 5'7"") i normally take a 10/12 and ordered this in a l.. it was somewhat clingy in the hip area but yet bulky on top. also, i like to have the first button open, but you could then see the v neck of the underslip and it looked hokey. it's definitely a thicker material than the previous plaid tunic holding"	0
"I received tons of compliments on this adorable jumper and felt like i was wearing comfy pajamas. i wore it to a baby shower and it was a hit. i'm 5'4"" and it was a bit long and needed to be hemmed, otherwise it's perfect!"	1
"I originally purchased these in a size 27 and they were big. i returned them and got a size 26, and they did stretch out after wearing them once - to the point where i could probably have gone done to a size 25. the cut, color, fabric and distressing are great. i am 5'3"" and the pants are a tad too long for me to wear them with ankle booties without looking odd. overall, i love these jeans and wear them a lot!"	1
Love this top! it's light weight and very comfortable! it's great for wearing around the house or going out for a casual dinner. would love to get it in more colors!	1
The pattern is cute. it's a little more subtle than in the photos. the problems were the skirt are 1: pretty sure it will wrinkle in two seconds and 2: it has buttons down the front of it with no lining behind it. which means, if you sit down wearing this skirt and it doesn't lay quite right, it gaps and you can see whatever is or is not underneath! the buttons are like two inches apart, so it's not a tiny little gap. no thanks. also, this skirt fir true to size, it wasn't tight, just gappy.	0
I have the white lemon lace shirt and love it so i was excited to see it in a color well suited for fall. the peacock pattern on the blouse i received is perfect and the pattern is well placed. i do love this one as much as the lemon blouse, however, the color is not the same as it appears online. it is more of a jade green color, and although it's pretty, i would have preferred it to look more of a blue color. i'm keeping it, as it is still an unusual and elegant blouse that's cute with dark sk	1
Amazing color- true to picture. it runs a bit large, even with layering underneath. i'm usually a 10/12 / l / 34d in tops and i needed the medium for a nice fit. i'm long-ish in the torso, and this sweater fits just slightly cropped, so really perfect with a longer button down underneath. the buttons on the back are a nice detail.	1
These paige skinny jeans are lightweight, snug, super soft and extremely flexible allowing for tons of movement. great for dressing up or down and a great addition to any ladies closet.	1
While these seem like interesting designs which i applaud!  the execution in the design of the fabric is not appealing.	0
The arm slits are actually subtle, and don't gape open. the chiffon type pleats are lovely, but the cotton material they overlay appears cheap and isn't dressy enough for my work.	0
And this one has a heavenly feel to it. i know it's not 100% cashmere, but it's soft and cozy. i love the understated colors and plan to wear it with a neutral/creme sweater. perfect to take from fall into winter.	1
Incredibly soft and comfortable, not as fitted as i would like (this often happens to me with skinny pants, though). i want to wear these guys everyday!	1
Love these pants! super comfortable, but feel high quality. i am usually a size 2 and the xs fits perfectly.	1
Soft cotton in very stylish yet simple style. regrettably, i listened to reviews that said it ran tts and ended up w a baggy long one that won't work even if i shrink it. that will teach me-- always order multiple sizes!	1
I loved this vest from the moment i saw it. sadly, though, it runs way too large. i first ordered it in a small and then an xs when it popped back. even the xs was too large around my shoulders and waist. the color was also a bit more beige than in the photos, which was ok, but i had to return it because of the size.	1
Love, love, love this sweater. it is so comfy and well made. this is a piece i will have for a very long time. the beautiful lace detail are the sleeves are to die for. picture doesn't do this sweater justice.	1
I just received this top and love it. the fabric is soft and comfy. it is just as pictured, no surprises. lace-up fronts are a hot item for spring. for reference, i am 5'7 and weigh #127. the xs fits perfectly.	1
I have purchased a lot from retailer but lately, some of the items have been disappointing in quality.verses cost, this being one. the picture is nice but the actual blouse is nothing like this. the size was not accurate so buy a size bigger because of the sleeves.	0
"This top isn't so much on the hanger but very cute once you try it. the neckline is really cut low so a pin or stitch is necessary. the length on the regular is perfect for my shorter body. if you have a long torso it might not work for you. love how the layers conceal but do not overwhelm your body.  i purchased my regular size medium in black. for reference: 5'6"", 145 lbs, 34dd."	1
I was expecting not to fit into this because i'm womanly, and generally wear a size 16 in things. but the picture was so gorgeous i had to try. i'm so happy i did. it slipped right on and is flowy yet not overly so. it still has shape. the colors are exactly as it is portrayed on the site. i love having this in my closet!	1
This dress is great! it's the perfect transition piece from summer to fall. it is very comfortable. the material and fit are similar to an oversized sweatshirt. overall, i love it.	1
I never write reviews, but these socks are so worth it! they are incredibly soft, stretchy, and hug your feet just tight enough where you don't even realize you're wearing socks, but they aren't too tight. i wash them straight away after wearing so i can wear them again. you won't regret it. true to color!	1
"I was on the fence about this dress because even on the model, it's a little bit frumpy, but it was so pretty that i tried it. however, on my short frame, it's even frumpier. the quality is very good, the fabric is soft and it's lined. the pattern is really pretty and delicate and i wish it was more flattering. i think the only way this dress will look good is if you are quite tall and thin. i am 5'4"", 110 lbs with large-ish hips and i ordered a 2p, but even the petite was too saggy. i needed a"	0
"I grabbed this on a lark because it look like a fun little ""throw on"" dress. it's a very lightweight sweatshirt material and fun and a fun flouncy design. run a bit large and regular sizing was still above my knees. if i were 30 years younger, i may have bought it just for lounging, but the over sized ruffly sleeves made me feel just a bit too silly and the color is pretty washed out. not for me, but cute for teens and early 20's."	1
"I just bought this dress as it went on sale recently. i read all the other reviews - and, imho, the dress is ivory not yellow as another reviewer suggested. i am only 5'2"" and weigh 115llbs - there were no petite sizes available so i bought a size 2 which is a bit long, but that's ok. the arm holes weren't too small and the neckline is large enough to slip over my head. the dress is very much a swing dress...i wish there was just a little less dress...it really is too voluminous for my taste. i"	1
"I tried this on in the store and it fit like a tent on me. it doesn't help that i'm 5'1"" and the store didn't have the petite sizes. maybe on a teller person it would work better. or maybe if i had been able to try the petite size it would have more wearable. it is a comfy style and the natural fiber is a plus. i have another holding horses dress that i love which also runs large. i did not mark this as ""runs large"" because the sleeves are more true to size while the bodice is very billowy. i wo"	0
This dress is truly a work of art, and i've received many compliments on it.  be warned, though, that it may require extensive tailoring to fit you. i'm 37-28-40 (so pretty darn hourglass shaped) and 5 feet 3 inches. i ordered the 8p. the dress was still huge in the the waist and not flattering at all. the neckline, also, was too low for my comfort. (if you're busty, necklines get pushed out and more things show.) my tailor was able to bring the neckline up by adding seams in the sleeves and	1
The material of this swimsuit is amazing. the swimsuit is expensive, but it is high quality in person. definitely one i'd recommend buying!	1
Full disclosure, i'm six months pregnant. as such, this dress is perfect for me. it's soft and flown, and i look like i have a cute bump instead of like i'm wearing a sack. i ordered my usual medium based on other reviews, and t fits perfectly--so it would have been too big normally.	1
I just purchased this tank in white and blue. i find it to be soft and will be perfect for hot days but also can wear into the fall with a cardigan. it's super comfy but i do find at retailer that it's best to try things on in the store (it's hard to find perfect sizes online since things are cut so differently based on the designer). i got a large and though it's a bit flowy in the tummy area, it fits nicely across my chest (not tight).	1
This tshirt hits at a great length not too long. so it doesn't make me feel top heavy! but it flows enough to hide any imperfections !   i ordered a medium.	1
Comfy. i bought the moss color i really like it. great causal pant for spring and summer	1
This is the perfect grab and go t-shirt. i love the fun design as it takes a simple t-shirt and makes it fun. i originally ordered the small but it was way to big for me especially at the waist. the bottom half of this top is much looser and if you want to have a more fitted look, size down. very cute.	1
"These culottes are fun. i bought the neutral color with the black stripes in xs. in my opinion, they run big. i am usually a small (4-6), 31"" waist, 38"" hips. pleats at the hip and low waist area are not always my friend, but with a longer tank or shirt, they looked fine. the fabric moves in a graceful way and these culottes can be dressed up or down. so far, wrinkling isn't a huge problem but we'll see. i am 5' 9"" tall and these fall about the same place on the model--mid calf. they looked grea"	1
Gorgeous and soft, luxurious feeling sweater! i purchased this in the pink/purple color that is no longer showing as available and just love it. it's unbelievably soft, feels like a blanket. i found that if you sort of fold the neck line under a little, it drapes like a cowl neck a little and not quite as off the shoulder....as it's very cold where i am...can't see wearing it that far off during the winter! that was my solution and i love it! i'm typically and xs, bought the xxs b/c it appeared	1
Tried this on to see if the size works in regular size, and i love the fir, it si very feminine and flattering. i will have to go back for it. both apttenrs are really nice, and it also comes in balck in my store. neckline is super flattering.	1
These pants are great! the color is beautiful & the fabric super soft. fit is slimmer than expected, but sill nice.	1
This tee is my favorite this year! it just looks great on! not fitted, but not loose either. i love it so much i have it in white, black, pink, light green, gray, slate blue and holly. the holly was my least favorite color (i thought it would look a little 'greener') it is so dark, you almost have to see it in the sunlight to be sure it is green. i ordered it online from the store and i kept it just because... i love the fact that it can be machine warned and dried without shrinking. i don't dr	1
This top is totally adorable. it's one of my favorite retailer tops this season. i wear it with jeans or even red skinny pants and i get tons of compliments on it. it fits true to size and the material is washable and durable.	1
I love the elbow patches on this shirt. i ordered the wine color, and it's dark enough to almost be a neutral. i've worn it with many things already. my only complaint is that the sleeves are super long. typically, long sleeved shirts are too short for me, so i'm guessing this one would be ridiculously long on someone with short arms.	1
I love almost everything about this. first, you know, it's cashmere -- soft soft soft without being heavy. i'm a little afraid to wear it it's so nice. i got the gray, which is a beautiful, light, casual shade of gray that looks great with everything. the pockets are fantastic if a bit useless (they hang lower than i can reach with my hands). the construction is a bit odd at first. it took me some brow-furrowing to figure out how to put it on, and i don't love the way the two front panels hang	1
The colors are so much brighter than pictured. although the sweater is very comfortable, i did not like the color combination. i will be returning it.	0
I am petite and ordered size small, and it came looking like gym sweat pants. the material was very nice, but in terms of the waist and length size, both run incredibly large. the cuff of the joggers are also not elastic at all, and hangs loose widely. will have to return this item, unfortunately.	0
It's super soft. it fits great. happy with the purchase.	1
I had been eyeballing this for a very long time because i loved the look of the skirt and this top (of which i snagged the skirt when it went on sale). i was delighted to finally take a chance and buy this when it went on sale, too. thoughts below: ______ pros: - it is well made and on the thicker side.  - for a peplum, it is actually slimming. i am an hourglass and with hips, which usually means such tops flare out so much making me look wider in all the wrong places. so i was skeptical abo	1
This didn't work for me. im normally a m (8/10). got this in xs. that was the correct size for me, i believe. however, the armholes were huge. husband said the top of the dress looked like the autobots symbol from transformers and he wanted me to keep it. but, i sent it back.	0
"I am 5'8"", 140lbs, pear-shaped. i ordered the s and it fit perfectly, just skimming the floor. the material is a beautiful gauzy metallic material that is lightweight with a beautiful drape and wonderful sorbet-inspired colors. the waistband is elasticized but not elastic, and there is no unflattering poofing, which can happen with skirts like this. the flaw, however, is in the decision to only half-line this skirt with an off-white jersey material. the half-lining isn't horrible but i found it"	0
This is a darling dress at this price point. i tried some of the more expensive options in the off-the-shoulder dresses this season and this one is as flattering and as well constructed as the others. the fabric is light but it is not sheer. it is smooth with a bit of a sheen. it is airy but not drapey like a rayon would be. i would describe it as a lawn. upon arrival the packaging indicated that it is considered a 'cover-up'. the site did not describe it that way but it may explain the comparat	1
I didn't love it enough to buy it, but did think it was cute. i am wearing a medium in the photos and for reference my measurements are 38-30-40.	1
According to the label, this dress can be hand washed or dry cleaned. i hand washed and line dried per the instructions on the label, and all the seams have completely shrunk and gathered. it looks like there's a drawstring running through every seam. so disappointed in the quality and the labeling. awful! i gave it one extra star because it's cute.	0
This is a gorgeous top. very well made with a classy design. it fits true to size from the lower chest up. however, at about the mid-belly range, the shirt widens out and basically allows a 5 month twin pregnancy to comfortably fit in. size xs. i was so sad. for the price, i can't justify taking it for alterations. it would have been the perfect top.	0
I can't wait for it to get colder so i can wear this out. love the ochre color paired with the maroon faux fur lapel. i especially love the detail at the pocket edges. very well made. the faux fur is luxuriously soft and removable. this will go great with denim and long skirts. the wool is a bit stiff in my opinion but that's okay. this will make a great addition to your autumn and winter closet. most of my outerwear are blacks or dark blues or dark greys so it's nice to be able to wear a bit of	1
"Loved this dress. i am 5'5"", 34c, normally wear a 2 in most. the 0 fit (a 2 wasn't available in-store), but i will say showed more cleavage on me than in the shown picture. gorgeous dress- wish it were just a little less costly, but would be a great purchase for easter, weddings, etc."	1
I loved this dress and wanted to use it for work. i read the reviews and saw all the issues with the slip and was nervous, but i tried it anyway and figured i could use another plain black slip i have if the one with the dress didn't fit. i'm really happy i did because it's a gorgeous dress. you just may need to wear a different black slip with it (i did). if you already have one, it's no additional hassle or cost and the dress is really unique. it's the perfect comfortable but stylish dress for	1
I finally tried this on now that it went on sale, and it was surprisingly flattereing. love the blue color, and i assume the purple was equally nice. fit is true to size as in i tried on the regular xs and it was great, long but ok for me,	1
This shirt is so very pretty in person. the detail on the neckline and the lace up on the back are so cute and give the shirt just a bit of whimsy, making it more unique than your usual flowy t-shirt. it lays perfectly and the material is very soft and comfy. you can wear it casual or dress it up. i may get another one because this is the kind of shirt i will wear constantly!	1
"I ordered this in the ""plum"" color, which in real life just looks like a very, very dark brown. that would probably be okay, but the dress is actually about 3 inches shorter than the listed measurements. i ordered the regular length, but the shortest part of the hem hits me only about halfway down my thigh...way, way too short. i am 5'5"", for reference. lastly, i think the fabric is just awful quality, especially for this price point. the slight texture makes it want to cling to itself - worn ou"	0
"I saw this dress online and drove to the store to try it on. i love it! i bought the tangerine color which is really red and blue (not black). i am 5'7"", 130 pounds, 34b and i got the xs. the small was too loose in the upper portion and the arm holes were big, like another reviewer reported. i have a long torso and the dress fit perfectly. it's a lovely, soft fabric and i will take it traveling with me as it won't wrinkle (and it's washable).the back is cut low, but surprisingly my bra didn't sh"	1
This top is the bomb. the red is a perfect balance of washed out but still rich. the thin spaghetti straps and scooped back make it sexy, but it still looks effortless. perfect to pair with light weight, light wash jeans. it's also nice that it's not clingy at all, lends to the casual look. total keep for me.	1
"This is the first time that i have tried mother jeans, and i am a fan. these jeans fit tts, and the high waist is flattering and stays put. i personally am a big fan of the distressing - it's just enough, but not too much - and it's lined on the inside so it won't get worse. i know some people won't like that, but i did. also, they hit right below my ankle (i'm 5'5"") instead of being a few inches too long -- a major bonus. thus, they look great rolled or not. but perhaps most importantly, these"	1
This is one of my favorite tops i've ordered. flowing and relaxed with great details at the neck. i get compliments every time i wear it.	1
This bathing suit is so cute. it fits me great. i'm 5'10 and about 130 and ordered a medium. my only complaint is that the outside straps sometimes fall off my shoulders, which could be annoying if you are doing anything active. but overall a great, modest and cute swimsuit.	1
This sweater/jacket looks just like the photo in real life, but the inside is so scratchy. i physically recoiled when trying it on as the interior of the sleeves feels like sandpaper. unlined and uncomfortable. no thank you! should you choose to proceed, i found the fit tts. i'm 5'8, wear an 8/10 and the medium worked for me.	0
This top is beautifully detailed , it is flattering and i am very happy with my purchase!	1
The fit on this skirt is flawless. i usually need alterations at the waist but this one was perfect for me. the buttons are so adorable and the color (orange) is vibrant and perfect for spring and summer. will wear this a lot!	1
Ordered these in 31p last year, prob could have worn a 30p, ordered 30p and 31p this year. the past couple of years the pilcro stet jeans in white fit me because they were cut straighter and not as curvy. this year neither size fit.  this year the cut changed and it has a curvier fit. it's the waist that doesn't work for me. if you're curvier this is probably a good fit change.	1
Perfect for day at the beach! i'm 5'6 and the length is just right above knee not too short. fresh and cool cotton. comfortable feel.	1
I loved the dog on this sweater, and i rushed into the store to buy it. once i tried it on, like others, i did find it to be itchy, but that i could deal with using a tank or something. what bothered me the most was the way the arms were cut. my arms looked much bigger than they are, so sadly i left it at the store. it really is a cute sweater though...	1
I bought this top in black and love it! the crossed straps in the back give it a stylish twist. i also tried it in white and found it to be a little see thru.	1
This top looked so cute in the picture, but unfortunately doesn't live up to it! the one i received, actually has the print shown in the photo on the inside of the shirt. it makes it much darker, and boring. the shirt itself is on the short side, and would've looked better if it hit lower on the hips, there's just too much fabric for it to land higher than that.	0
"This tunic is simple and well made. it was not as long as on the model as on me but i am 5'-9""."	1
Got these in the red brick color, and unfortunately had to send them back. these are really cute and i loved the color and pattern, but they ran very small, and the cut between the legs and hips was odd. this may not have been a problem had i gone up at least one size. best to try them on if possible.	0
I liked the way the dress looked in the front, but the material in the back was knit and very clingy. i did not think it was flattering on me.	1
So glad i ordered this dress. it fits true to size and is extra soft. i was unsure about the color, but it looks nicer in person. the fabric is a mid weight that hangs nicely. this will go great with leggings or tights and wear into spring.	1
I am always searching for effortless items. this is a cute and classic shirt that meets all those requirements. i actually really like the sleeves. it take a basic tee and elevates the style. i bought the teal but am also thinking about ordering the white too. can't go wrong with a classic white tee.	1
Could not wait for this to come and so disappointed.  first of all, it's not a happy orange, it a darker rust.  second, it is huge.  fits in the shoulders and is super comfy and cute but would be a dynamite maternity top.  you could go to term in this blouse!  back it goes.  so sad.	0
Great with a tank top underneath and jeans. i also wore with a delicate gold necklace. charming!	1
Awesome flares and very flattering! a wardrobe staple!	1
Really wanted to love this top but the proportion was not right for my body type. also the print with the silhouette was a bit too country bumpkin for me.	1
Super soft and super chic! this sweater wrap looks great at the mall, at church, and even just curling up with a hot drink on a cold day at home. i'm still in love with this after a year!	1
I really loved the color and fabric of this sweater. i liked everything about it except how wide it was at the bottom. i returned it for this reason.	0
I ordered the medium pink in a size small. the color is more of a hot pink. it runs small through the shoulders and bust (i'm 34-d). i like that it covers your bum and the detail down the back. but it is going back, i may try a medium petite in a different color.	1
And runs large. i'm always a size 8 in dresses and the 8 was too big. i would buy it in a 6 if the color was closer to what i'm seeing online.	1
Comfortable but if you put in the dryer, even on low it will shrink a little so beware	1
"I bought this in blue/black. it is so pretty. i get so many compliments. i'm a size 4/6 but large busted. i bought this in a medium & it's perfect. just the right amount of fullness. i'm 5'4"" so the length for me is perfect w/leggings."	1
I just sent this back. it is very cute & the fabric is great, so soft & comfy, but it doesn't work with my shape. it is extremely swingy in shape and the buttons up the front only work if you don't have a large chest. on me, it looks like maternity and it gaps when i button it. am a 34dd. it's not the fault of the top, but a bigger size would have swallowed me. i think if you are thin and also not top-heavy like the model, this will be adorable on you. i am just too busty.	1
I bought the ivory in my usual size xs and the fit is flattering and quality is good. it is a good weight for spring, summer and fall. i love that it is a natural cotton/linen blend. the turquoise was not available in my size initially but when it restocked for a short time i ordered it, also! i know i won't be disappointed. beautiful sweater with great details.	1
As soon as i tried on this cardigan i knew i had to have it. it takes your outfit to a glam and high end look. the fabric is oh so soft and i loved how it draped. the sleeves hang low and give you a vintage feel. i would give this a 5 star rating however, the downside to this cardigan is the shedding! it shed all over my black pants when i wore it, and on my friends too! :( i really went back and forth on returning this, but i think it's so beautiful i am keeping it. i am hoping over time the sh	1
This product is the best if not the most excellent garment i have purchased in years i feel like a model even though i am full body lady what gorgeous piece of clothing	1
No need to be on the fence about this top, it's lovely! what you see pictured here, is exactly what you get, even the color of the top is 100% accurate. for reference i'm usually an xl/16, apple shape, 40 c bust, and this xl does not cling at all to me, so you may even be able to size down. the drape of the clipdot fabric is flattering, and thick enough not to need a cami. all of the fabrics used are nice and soft... and the details! it's going to be a beautiful spring!	1
This shirt is beautiful.its very light weight and great summer tee. don't hesitate to buy this, you won't be disappointed.i usually don't buy t-shirts that are quite this pricey, but i knew it might not last till it went on sale.runs a bit large and since it is linen, it will likely stretch a bit.(i have not worn it yet)	1
"I love how comfortable this dress is, it does run a little large so i would order a size down. i'm 5'3"" and around 125lbs and had to exchange the xsp for an xxsp."	1
I love this top so much i tried it on twice. because i forgot why it didn't work the first time: i have a chest. i'm just a c cup, but i looked lumpy and matronly in this top. if that's not an issue for you, i think you'll love it.	1
This sweater is even better looking in person. the body of the sweater is substantial - a nice weight. the lace is gorgeous. i usually wear a size large but found the sleeves really long. i purchased a medium and it fits better - sleeves are perfect.	1
"First off, the dress quality is great, the fabric is very nice, the color is great. i am 5'4"", 150 lbs. the dress looked like a parachute on me, very unattractive, because the fabric is pretty stiff. i quite honestly looked pregnant."	0
I'm still on the fence about these. i realize they got great reviews but i thought they would be a bit thicker. they just feel too flimsy and too much like i'm ready for bed. i was looking for more lounge pants that i felt like if i needed to run up to the store on a saturday afternoon that i wasn't wearing pjs. i just can't get past that. they are totally cute but i was definitely looking for more summer lounge-wear. i ordered the small which fit fine. i wear 4-6 in retailer pants. i got the p	1
"While this shirt does run a little large, i am 5' 0"" and ordered a petite small, it is perfect for layering under a loose cardigan. can be dressed up or down- looking forward to wearing it this summer!"	1
Purchased this in two sizes because other reviews said it runs small. i found that it was true to size for me .cant wait until it is warm enough to wear it!	1
Such a fun and beautiful skirt, absolutely love the cut and the way it flows when walking ! it is very very bright in my opinion and not so much my style so i will be wearing it sparingly! got a ton of compliments the first time wearing it	1
These are very fun and breezy pants. i first ordered a medium, but the waist was too low. i exchanged for a large and i love the fit now. i like them loose and airy. for reference i am usually a 10-12 petite and the l regular is super cute ;0) i hope they wash well. they are perfect for the hot and humid northern va summer.	1
Anytime i see this brand at retailer in a button down, i have to buy it. fit is always so flattering, comfy and the prints are always great!	1
Now i would've been scared off by the fabrics had i not seen the cute, flattering cut if this spring top. love the futuristic look of the fabric and style brought back by the rise design throughout. like the previous reviewer claims, this top is even cuter on us non models (who are pry not as washed out). the color combo is another positive because it's both flattering and versatile!	1
This tank caught my eye in the store yesterday. i was taken by the design contrast of the front and back. the colors are beautiful and rich. i see this as the perfect tank to transition into the fall season. the top does run a little big. i sized down to a medium. i am just under 5'5 and am a 36g.	1
"This top is well made and fits me like a glove. i am only 5'1"" but have a very muscular build. the xs fits perfectly--slimming around the torso but roomy enough in the shoulders and arms. the fabric is a nice upgrade from typical flannel."	1
"I am very glad i purchased these shorts on sale. bought the coral color in a large. 5'7"" 140lbs with a generous underside and long legs, i usually wear a m or a l in yoga pants. the l here fits really nicely--not too tight and enough length in the inseam so that i don't feel silly practicing outdoors in the park. the rise is also perfect."	1
I bought the white tank and the small fits me but it's very low cut for me. the white is sheer as well. i usually wear an xs or a small and i would be curious to see what the xs would fit like in the sense of how low cut it is.	1
This reminds me of the 1970's. the fabric is soft and it looks just like the picture. i'm ordering it in line in a petite. my store doesn't carry petites. it's typical moth quality and fit. perfect.	1
The stitched pattern on this shirt is so pretty! it fits loosely and looks good with a slimmer bottom. it is a little bit itchy but i didn't feel i needed to wear something underneath.	1
"This is just as it looks. a minimalist, elegant, dark navy skirt that provides a classic feminine shape and looks like it could last for years. it is straight, so you might want to consider sizing up unless you're quite slender. i'm 5'10"" and 160 and am sending back a m for a l. excited to get my new skirt and to wear it."	1
I had my eye on the umbrella print shirt for a while. i was able to scoop it at a small discount. i typically get a 2 in maeve tops but per the reviews i got a 4, i definitely could have done with a 2 but i'll probably stay with what i have. adorable print, comfortable, well made.	1
I finally found these jeans!! love them and have been wearing them almost everyday!	1
I purchased this top in the rose and steel blue colors even though the majority of reviews says it shrinks even when you wash per the instructions. i called the local retailer store first to see if it could be returned if this happened and they said yes, no problem. well the reviews are correct. i washed just the rose colored top so i could compare it to the steel blue if it did shrink. i am returning them this evening. i will not take the time or spend the money to dry clean a tank. it is made ve	0
"Didn't love it, didn't hate, rather indifferent. the grey was a little more muted than i wanted for a summer tee. i'm 5'4"", 123lbs, 34a, the xs fit if it wouldn't shrink, if you're about this size but larger busted go with the s."	1
This shirt is made of a thicker material, so you are able to wear it through multiple seasons. i also liked that it is a bit longer. however, it runs a little large, so i would order a size down if possible.	1
"Love the design of these pants and they are super comfortable. perfect for running errands but managing not to look like you just rolled out of bed. bought the regular m size (usually i want petite because i'm 5'1"") and while they are a little long they still fit relatively well"	1
Color is very nice and dark, with just a little fading around the knee. i sized down to 25 from my usual 26-27 (5.4' 120 lb).	1
"The print, layers and fit of this dress remind me of the 1990's but in a good way! the outer dress is voluminous and flowy, so i understand why some reviewers feel the dress runs large. the embroidered slip is tts and quite the cherry on top. i really appreciate that styling detail. 140# 36dd 5'3"" and i chose medium regular length, not petite since i'm older and wanted the length."	1
When i first saw this shirt in person i was shocked because the lines on it are sparkly and colorful.  now that i look closely at the shirt online i see that, but i did not expect it cause it wasn't as obvious in the online photos.  it is much more prominent in person. i ordered it in my usual size and it fits perfectly - just like the model, definitely oversized but appropriately so.  the length was also great (i'm 5'8) which made me very happy.	1
"I love these pants! the pattern is polished and the flowy style is perfect for warm weather. i ordered a small and was worried they would be too short (i'm 5'10""), but they are just right when i wear them just slightly lower than my true waist. my new favorite summer pants."	1
"Very pretty blouse. i love the print, and color of the pink floral. tts, i ordered the xs, because of the roomy cut of the blouse. i'm 5'8"", 117 lbs. it fit great. the cut is a little wider then pictured, but still cute. not to short as mentioned by another review, and i have a longer torso, i wasn't crazy about the victorian collar, so tucked it under, and it looks great!"	1
I have had my eye on this dress since the spring (in yellow), but it sold out quickly. i jumped on this dress as soon as i saw it come out in different colors this fall! i purchased the peach color and it is really lovely. i will be wearing this dress for family photos. the lace and the details are so very pretty! i am usually a size 0 or 2, and purchased in size 2 since there is no stretch to it. it is a beautiful dress and i highly recommend it! wish it came in white!	1
"I'm 5'5"" 120 lbs and i bought these in a 0. they fit great. i wore them for upwards of 12 hours and i was very comfortable. i received compliments on the print and cut. very flattering."	1
I ordered this in a small petite and medium petite , and i am a huge fan of a*k. i put tried on the sp. while it fit, it was very long, even for a petite. what i hated about it was that the piping on the top made me look very wide. even a long necklace wouldn't help deter the look. on a positive side, the blue was a very nice, cool color. i am usually a small to medium in a*k (6-8 in tops) and the small fit well in the arms/bodice, just too much fabric for me. returning!	0
I like the design of the dress, but the fabric makes it look cheap. for an expensive dress, i had expected better quality.	0
I tried this on in the store and was sad that the small was a little unflattering around my mid section.  couldn't stop thinking about the dress though, so checked reviews online from home...many said to size up. i ordered a medium and it is perfect! fits so nicely now and the fabric is so cozy!! i thought the top would be too big in a larger size but it still looks good.	1
This is quite long on my 5'1 frame but it's wool and will be amazing in the fall and winter. so happy i finally ordered this	1
"Nice vest, pretty olive color, hangs nice but...its just kinda funny. just hangs and really looks odd when tied. i like the laying piece just wished it had more ""umph""."	1
"I love the muted red pleated ruffle tank. i usually wear a large in retailer tops. this top fit a bit loose. there is a bit more space around the armholes. this only concerns me because i can't wear a bra or cami without it showing. just mentioned this in case others may wish to buy one size smaller. i am 68, around 5/5"" and weight 144 lbs. love the young, modern tops that i find at retailer. i just ordered the white version of this tank top in a medium to see how it will fit (btw, there is a"	1
I feel for the reviewer who didn't like this top. i tried on my normal size medium and it was not very flattering (just too short). when i sized up, everything changed. this top is amazing--super flattering and high quality. i love the material, v-cut, and subtle way the tassels hang. i wish they had more colors-i would buy them all! this top sold out in a day at my store. it's a winner-just make sure you size up.	1
"Finally received this in the mail today and was very disappointed. i am swimming in the xs (5'4"", 110lbs). the colors are much more vibrant that shown in the pics - the green is a bright kelly green, the red is much more red than rust colored, etc. and it's a sweater coat! for the price i was expecting it to be lined and higher quality. i don't doubt that it will be warm, but can't justify the price. it's going back to the store."	0
I bought this earlier in the summer in size xl. i've gotten such good use out of it. the fit on me matches the model. the details of the crochet lace add such a nice touch. not your typical hoodie. but, just the same comfort. i've washed in cold in my machine & air dried. it hasn't shrunk. one of my favorite purchases. perfect for chilly weather or when you go into a/c areas. would love this in other colors. great piece!	1
I loved the styling of this dress the first time i saw it. i ordered it and i slipped it on and wow! it is super comfortable. the darts at the waist add shape and interest. the shape highlights the waist. the fabric is cozy without being weighty. i did find it ran large and wish there was an xxs available. my husband loved it and he doesn't like anything! it is likely that the reviewers who think that t looked like a nightgown may have needed a smaller size. i think this one is a diamond in the	1
This top is so beautiful and well made, and the detailing in the back is gorgeous. it's unexpected and makes this piece really special. it does run a tiny bit large; i've gotten retailer chambray a before, and they usually shrink a touch in the wash and then for just right. i haven't washed this yet, but even a little large it fits well and hangs nicely without being overly baggy. get this, you won't regret it!	1
This dress is very well made and the fabric hangs beautifully. i weigh 125 and usually wear a small but sized up to medium for a longer sleeve and hem. the print, fabric and style make it appropriate for daytime or evening. it should transition nicely to fall and will look great with boots.	1
I ordered the blue stripe and white in size large. i didn't like it worn off shoulder but it does stay in place, which is a good thing. and it looks okay worn on the shoulders. i find the fabric so uncomfortable and itchy that i couldn't wait to take it off, immediately. i tried them on again a second time, still hopeful, with the same outcome. sadly, returning.	1
I liked the colors of this dress and the material was fine, but i could not tell from the pictures that the seams at the waist are atypical and frankly unflattering. they are scalloped at the hips, so it looks horrible if you have any hips at all.	0
This is cute with the shoulder detail. i ordered a medium- will be returning for a small. i'm kind of in between small & medium.	1
I had sized down because i'm usually a petite, but didn't have the option for petite here, and it was still too big. a petite or an additional size down could have helped the fit, but in the end the style wasn't what i was going for. the dress has a little more texture going on than what is revealed in the photo here on the site -- i thought it was a luxurious brocade fabric, but the shininess actually comes from silky threads on a mesh-ish overlay. it's a lovely, quality dress, and the color is	0
Just received these and they fit perfectly, but the panels are different shades of gray. the color is not consistent and it make them look bad. they are perfect otherwise, but sadly they are not wearable. i will be returning	0
I never write reviews although i do most of my shopping online but i had to write one for this tunic. i got it in the blue and sized down from a small to extra small- although i ordered both to see. the smaller size fit better around the shoulders. it is a bit retro funky and elegant at the same time. great price for such a quality piece.	1
I bought this in size xl. it ran much shorter & smaller than is typical for this brand. i found the arms tighter on me compared to the model's photos. the lace itself was pretty, intricate and washed well. i wish this shirt had worked but i ended up donating it after wearing it a couple times. the cropped length and close-fit just didn't work on me. i thought the sleeve shape was pretty. with just a little more material, this would have been a favorite. i hope it works well on whoever receives i	0
I needed a legging to wear with boots. makes sense that if it is cold enough to wear boots in socal then it is too cold to wear thin leggings. try to find warm leggings....almost impossible until retailer put fleece lined leggings in their catalogue! the leggings have a vertical knitted stripe which elongates the leg and they are warm! perfection in garments is very rare but these leggings are hot.	1
"The inseam is advertised as 28"", but they are more like 38"". i was hoping they were for short people, but they are for someone with very long legs, event in my tallest heels, i'd have to get them hemmed! just a warning to my short friends out there. the quality, fit, look was great, but way way way too long."	1
When i received the dress, it was true to size on the bust and length. i didn't purchase the petite, but i wish i did since i am 5'2. i tried to wear my wedges, but it's still long. i love the dress and would definitely recommend it.	1
"I agree with a previous reviewer who said that it was very nicely cut, but unfortunately, the materials are so cheap. the ""fleece"" material that it is made out of feels like the cheap polyester fleece blankets that you get at the discount stores. it will pill easily, and is noticeable even in the dark color. i must have gotten one shipped straight from the store, and it was already starting to do some gnarly pilling. i do love the cut of it, but i can't justify keeping it because this won't last"	0
"This top is so beautiful!  really well made with solid embroidery - not the thin lightweight type.  i thought it ran rather large but i don't have the bust to fill in the top area.  i'm usually a small in tops (sometimes medium due to my height 5'8"") but went down to an xs so the arm holes didn't show too much.  length was still great.  a steal at the sale price!"	1
Very nice casual, inexpensive shirt and the laced neckline is great....not too revealing and easily worn tied  without looking prudish. and of course, open as well	1
After reading all the reviews, i ordered up a size. the problem isn't that it runs small. it's that they took the bodice of a true size and stuck it on the skirt of a small size. or if you want to think of it differently - the bodice of a large size on to the skirt of a true size. the 4 top with the 6 bottom would be perfect. unfortunately - you get a size 4 fitted bodice with a skirt that puckers at the back and shows all your flaws (spare tire) or a size 6 that is atrociously long in the torso	0
A slip underneath makes this dress substantial. it's a good 'weather' transition dress-fall/spring. the lace is very pretty and it's an overall great dress that will take you anywhere. i plan to wear burgundy tights and brown boots with ti next weekend.	1
Love these shorts - got 2 pairs on sale just because it's hard to find shorts that fit nicely and are comfy with a great length.	1
I ordered the green version in size xl. i knew it was cropped and it fits me as shown on the models. so, i think that's true to size. the knit is very soft. but, it's the color that's amazing--such a rich bright emerald green! i love the look of it. it's awkward fitting on my pear-shape. i layer a long tank underneath with this on top. but, the hemline of the sweater cuts at an unflattering place. still, the softness and the beautiful color make it a staple in my closet. when i'm staying at home	1
I bought this in black and the checkered pattern. love both. very floaty and feminine. fits true to size.	1
These are my new favorite jeans. the gray wash is nice, and the distressing is subtle enough that i can wear these to work. the rise is high enough that i don't need to worry about bending over but not so high that they get near my belly button. and the description is true: they don't stretch! i'm a loyal ag stevie shopper, and the fit on these is similar... just a little skinnier in the ankles, maybe. true to size. a little long, so i'll probably hem them a couple of inches.	1
I washed and dried this in my dryer after one wear and it shrunk to the size of a toddler shirt. i dried it on medium. i can not really wear it unless i want to show off my belly. i loved the color (lilac). fit, and style when i received it and immediately put it on. so sad about the shrinkage. for a $58 shirt i expected a bit more. retailer should suggest air drying the shirt. so bummed and disappointed!!!! i would not recommend this shirt unless you can remember to air dry it every time.	0
Adorable, true to size and just as pictured. there is no hook and eye clasp as stated but still cute. light weight and will be perfect over dresses and summer tanks. wish there were additional colors. i love the white though.	1
Got this in the red, like previous reviewer mentioned - it does fit snug. you might need to size up if you are busty and want a much looser fit. other than that, super comfortable and soft fabric	1
It breaks my heart to say this but i had to return for shape issues. i am not a fan of dolman sleeves (they make me look big and bulky) and i wished i would have known that prior to purchasing. it is unfortunate because it is a really beautiful knit and quality. i could see this working better on someone tall and thin.	0
I love this top so much that i ordered it in second color. it is shorter but still works with skirts and pants. the material is a fun texture. i didn't have any problems with the arm holes, but this may be due to being less full in the bust area.	1
"As others mentioned, love the little buttons, and the cut is flattering. i ordered the ""denim' one (multicolor). i didn't end up keeping it but will order again if goes to sale. likes: colors are fun, material is soft, buttons are beautiful, cut is decently flattering. what i didn't love is it looks wrinkled. i ordered the xxs and xsp - only tried on xxs as i didn't think i would keep it anyway, but thinking of it, is should have still tried the xsp. arms were almost snug on me (i lift weight"	1
I've been hesitant with crushed velvet comeback...but this dress is adorable! first, it is not a tent; on me it's the perfect fit for the style - not too swingy but definitely not fitted. this is the dress you can grab on a day you don't feel like sucking it in, throw a blazer over it if you need you look professional, wear to a girls brunch with booties or a night out with the hubs. the little extra detail i didn't see online that was a pleasant style surprise is the almost strap-looking piece	1
I did like this top, but it was a little big- i bought a size 4 and i have a size 32 chest. the color is great, the fabric is amazing, but it just didn't fit me perfectly. i thought about trying a smaller size, but i just wasn't sure that i would wear it a lot.	1
This dress is beautiful and unique - the cutouts and lace really stand out. however, the dress was huge on me and that is rare with moulinette souers. i usually get a 0 or 0p in this brand due to the bust sizing being generally smaller but the 0 regular was huge and the armholes really big. the petite may have been better but felt that it would have been too short. while the design is beautiful, there were several areas on the dress where the threads were unraveling. for reference, i am 24 waist	0
Very pretty top, comfortable and soft but looks nice enough for work!	1
I'd hoped these would be cozy and warm. the fabric is thin and slinky. it grabs and emphasizes every bump and roll. couldn't wait to get them off. just horrible. and that price is very steep. can't recommend.	0
I was disappointed with this dress because it is not the usual retailer quality. the quality of the material is not very good. i've bought boiled wood jackets from this brand before and they're very soft and very well made, hence my disappointment. i agree with the other reviewers in that this dress runs very large and the length is short for a winter dress.	0
I liked the jeans, but exchanges them for ag's stevie ankle jeans due to the difference in length. i love pilcro, but these were just a bit too long on me.	1
The fabric and its texture didn't meet my expectations unfortunately. there were too much fray and cast-off of edge yarns of a fabric...  however this will fit if you wear over the swimming wears.	0
"Maeve has done it again with a fabulous blouse. i bought in the blue motif and the colors are so wonderfully fall. the length is great for skinny jeans and leggings. loved that it covered the rear end as well. i am 5'5"", 135lbs, curvy/athletic frame, 34c and the size small fit well."	1
I don't normally like how i look in rompers but this one was so cute i had to try.  i was pleasantly surprised that it fit great and was comfortable too!	1
First, i absolutely love cloth & stone. but lately i'm finding some of the styles are going in a direction that just doesn't fit my style. that's ok because they still have some good basics.  what i mean is the cut. a lot of their pieces are super long in the back and super short in the front (ie their slip dress they have out right now). this particular tank is like that, although this one is borderline. the sides cut up a little too high for my tastes and i can't help but think i'm wearin	0
"There is no back zip on this skirt and therefore it does not lay flat as it would if there were a zip. instead it has an elastic waist. it is very nice quality but i never would have purchased this skirt if i knew it had an elastic waist. i am 5'6"" and a size 6. it runs a bit large - i think this is due to the elastic waste."	0
This is a very pretty dress and looks just as it's pictured.  however, there is a lot of fabric - the lower half is very full and runs very large.	1
I bought this in aqua. the color is beautiful. the quality of the cashmere is great. i have worn this 3 times since purchasing! this can be dressed up or down. the cowl neck is not overwhelming and looks great with a shorter chunky necklace or even a scarf. flattering hem line. very versatile.	1
After reading the reviews about this top being really clingy, i decided to order up a size and purchased a medium. when i took it out of the box today and held it up it looked huge and i thought i had made a mistake. however when i tried it on it actually fit really well! i could see if i had ordered my usual small how it would have clinged to my body in a unflattering way. very happy with the top and thankful for the reviews.	1
"I loved this dress after seeing it online.it is a pullover dress, and is easy to get on. my major problem with the dress is that the waist is extremely high (about 3 inches over my natural waist), and i usually have no problem with the placement of the waist in dresses. i'm going to keep the dress because i like everything else about it: the fit is flattering and the dress will be seasonless here in california. i""ll search for a wide belt to cover the waistline, or perhaps skip a belt altogether"	1
I love the cold shoulder trend, and this top seemed to satisfy. i bought it in the blue, which is really more like a very light mint green. however, i think the material is pretty thin (though soft), and the keyhole sleeve area, right by the twist, is not substantial so it looks a little cheap. i ordered the small, but i think i could have definitely sized down to the xs (110 pounds, 32dd). it's very loose fitting but i wouldn't say it looks bad. it's just a very relaxed fit. for the price, thou	1
Love this! i sized up to xl from large.. great pattern. very soft. i am thick legged and big booty. this romper is the perfect length. the only issue is when i need to use the bathroom. hard to unzip from the back in a hurry. i had my husband unzip for me in order to pull down.	1
"I was so excited to try these, it's hard to find cute bermuda shorts. the legs were so wide. my husband asked if i was wearing his shorts. they don't look that wide in the picture. i am 5'4"" and 130 lbs i bought my regular size 28 but the waist was huge i could have sized down one or two sizes. unrolled they came to my knee."	0
I loved the delicate and feminine print of this blouse at first sight. the fit was perfect - just enough room to be flattering and comfortable, without adding any unnecessary bulk. the style and print could even be paired with a more classic skirt and pumps and go to the office. the length was also spot-on - it's not too long to be a tunic, yet long enough to wear with skinny jeans or even leggings on an errand-running day. the blouse is very lightweight and sheer, making it that much more comfo	1
This dress is amazing! i bought this dress for my daughter for her college graduation. it fits like a dream. she normally wears a size 2 but i got the 4 which was perfect. with the slightly longer length, it is very professional but with the lace cut outs is great for a party, as well. it is very flattering and well made.	1
I ordered the black and white version online, and the dress fit perfectly. it was very well-made with a nicely textured, heavier cloth, and the overall appearance is very classy. it is a versatile dress, and i would highly recommend it!	1
This dress was cute but the fit was not quite right. the bottom half fit well but the top half was a little loose. it was wearable but i was worried after wearing for a few hours it would stretch out even more and look frumpy. like other reviewers have said, this dress really needs a belt to bring it together. i ended up returning it because i didn't love it.	0
Great top that can be worn so many ways. i bought the top in gray because it is way more interesting in person. it has just a touch of sparkle in it and lots of texture. i have seen this top on several people and it seems to flatter lots of different body types.	1
I purchased this in both the green color and the grey color and am in love with both. they are much longer than last years design and it has a pretty weave to the sweater with multiple layers that sit perfectly past the hips. the fit is true to size although the fabric is quite thin and i worry about pulls. also, the sleeves are a bit long, but this doesn't bother me too much at this point. very versatile!	1
Very cute, great fit and super comfortable. perfect for fall with tall boots	1
I ordered one of each color in size xl. the fit is true to size. it matches the model's photos. there's a lot of material so it's flowy. but, it shrunk with air-drying. the colors are very pretty in person. the white is bright. i decided to keep mine even though they're truthfully, unflattering to wear. the way the sleeves are slightly gathered and cut, make my shoulders & arms look huge. i don't have the shape to pull this off. but, for wearing at home in the summer, they're worth having. the m	0
This shirt is nice and flowy. it can be dressed up or down. very lightweight for summer, but the color will work for early fall too.	1
"I'm 5'7"" 155lbs and ordered a large. it fit, but the arms were awkwardly short. the finish details on the end of each sleeve almost would have to be pushed back to the elbow for it to look right, which would be okay. however, the interior seam of the neckline is cut jaggedly and isn't even finished with any stitching. it's just tucked haphazardly inside the neckline and isn't sewn--it would unravel with washing.  it's soft and snuggly and cute if you get it on super-sale and don't mind it com"	0
I love the idea of ruffles, but this shirt was huge! i normally wear a small or medium, and i got the small. it felt more like a large to me. maybe if you size down 1-2 sizes, it will work out for you. i'm going to take it back rather than exchange. i also wish it was a more lightweight material for summer, but it's pretty thick.	0
As the previous reviewer mentioned, this dress is great for a dress that doesn't have a true waist. it really fits awesome. so incredibly soft, high quality material, and the mesh pockets are perfection (pockets that are so small/light that you can't tell the dress even had them when looking at it!). the color of the dress is what initially drew me to it (definitely a different color for a sun dress) and after trying it on in stores i would say 'beware.' though it truly is a rich and different c	1
Love these! loose and comfy everywhere. delighted to have found a 32, and delighted that they are roomy, even at the waist. i exchanged another pair of pilcro's and was afraid of a shipping/pricing conflict, but as usual, retailer customer service was excellent. earlier sale price was honored, easy returns in the orignal shipping bag..  retailer design, fashion and company attitude excels!	1
I love this jacket - can dress it up or dress it down. over a dress, skirt or jeans. very soft and flattering!	1
"Saw this in the catalog and had to have it.  i paid full price!   while the buttons aren't functional, it is not too revealing.  i work in a casual office and it will be perfectly appropriate especially paired with a jean jacket!   the length is right above knee.  i am 5'6"" 122# and went with the xs"	1
I tried it on in the store & loved it but didn't purchase. then the retailer sale happened so i had to order it. it's lightweight and perfect for southern california. the embroidery adds funk and femininity. i'm 45 and feel like this works well for any age. i'm typically a large or 12 and the large fit perfect. i can't wait till the temps drop so i can wear it!!!	1
This is a very cute dress. it was perfect before i washed it. the problems i had after washing it was the outer cotton layer of the dress shrunk length wise while the inside black lining did not, so the black lining peeks out a good inch or two. and since the dress is shorter i can't really wear it without using biker shorts, especially for the back of the dress since it's shorter there and if i bent over you could see everything. i'm so disappointed in the quality because it is a very cute, ver	0
Gorgeous shirt! the detail on this shirt is impeccable! even with its boxy shape, it was very flattering on my petite, curvy frame. i'd say this shirt runs just a tad big. i'm 5' 118lbs and the xs fit perfectly.	1
This top was really cute on someone else, but not on me... on me, ti was too big and the color washed me out. the fabric is nice and the pattern and colors are nice too, just not on porcelain skin... like many tops this season, it is a bit boxy, but looks nice with jeans, white shorts or half-tucked into a skirt. i would probably size down a bot...	1
I love this cozy jacket. i wanted a neutral colored jacket for casual outings. this does fit true to size. i am 5' 2'' and 105 pounds. i purchased the xs. you can cuff the sleeves to shorten the length of the arms. it has a piping so it doesn't look odd if cuffed. i do find most things/brands at retailer run big on me but not this item.	1
It's a pretty dress, my only concern is the sleeve length. it's an awkward length and makes the dress look a little frumpy. i turned the sleeve up once and it looks so much better!. or, if you are a savvy sewer, you may want to tighten a little in the arms so the sleeve is a bit more fitted. overall quality and feel is very good. i usually fit into a 6, but for this dress i ordered both 6 and 8 and kept the 8. the chest is a bit snug and the button pops open if you don't order the correct size.	1
The length is perfect. the cut of the hemline makes it off the charts cute. i love it w ghillie type flats or booties. pair w a big warm sweater, or a sleek turtleneck, and watch heads turn as you enter the room! i promise! love this skirt.	1
I bought this in-store and it is much nicer than it appears in the photos online. the fabric is soft and drapey, making the top lightweight and flowy. this is not a fitted shirt, and i didn't feel it was overly large, so i think it runs true to size. i felt fine in an xs. t did feel the need to wear a camisole/ tank with it, but i tend towards the modest side. i bought it with the wide-legged linen pants and have worn it with wedge sandals with many compliments! i wish i'd noticed the navy blue	1
This shirt is a steal at the sale price. i've received many compliments. it is a swing top- so not a lot of form. i wear a cami underneath & have found the style to be comfortable for work.	1
Not sure who this is for but its not for me. skirt was long, stiff and puffy on my hips. i could not get it to lie correctly. maybe you have to be 6' to pull this off...	0
I found this top to be very beautiful and well made. the fabric is on the lighter side, however for me that is a double plus. it is great for layering with a cami underneath and/or a heavier sweater on top. and going towards spring it extends wearing time. the lace on the sleeves is beautiful and a pretty peek a boo effect if layered under another sweater. it 's a subtle sexy top with endless possibilities. i found it runs very true to size. i purchased the aqua and after receiving it i rushed t	1
Love me some pilcro jeans! these fit like the stet jeans. i got my usual size 27p and the fit is good but not too tight. i am not crazy about the hem but they feel so good that they are worth it. they don't come above my ankle like on the model but come slightly below which i really like. i will say that if you want a true black, you may not like this color. they are more of a faded black.	1
Love this romper. fits perfectly, and looks like the picture. i'm 5 ft 7, 125 lbs, and usually am a size 4 or small. i ordered a small, and it fits beautifully. i've worn this a lot this summer in florida, and am getting a lot of compliments. don't be put of by the long sleeves for summer wear- the romper is loose enough and has a nice flow to it.	1
I wanted to love this dress! i ordered it when there was a 20 percent off special and couldn't wait to get it. the colors are as depicted and the dress fit true to size. i also liked that it wasn't too short. what i didnt like was that the dress is lined in white, which you can plainly see in the picture, but i didnt notice before ordering. i just think it would have been much prettier lined in black. im disappointed and the dress is going back.	0
"I was specifically looking for a nice pair of high-waisted jeans and this pair fit the bill. i am a little unsure about the unfinished hem hence the 4 rating on design, i would have preferred a finished hem. i am 5'4"" and they are a tad shorter than i normally like to wear my jeans. i have had them for a couple of days, still deciding whether to keep them despite the fact that i really love them other than these two issues."	1
I tried this on in my usual size and it was tight through the chest because of the lining. i would have preferred to wear a cami beneath and then it may have worked. the color and pattern are gorgeous, the fabric feels a bit weird, kind of dry and rough? would have liked to see this in a longer length, and more tapered. it is an absolute pregnant top. so sad its so pretty!	1
I often have a hard time finding items that fit true to size, but this top fits perfectly. it is cut really well and very flattering.	1
This is really cute - it has a boxy look and bell-like sleeves. the knit is chunky and so very soft. i didn't want to take it off. i purchased an xs in black. it's gorgeous. my beige bra shows through so i will need to wear black or a camp underneath. it feels really heavy - in a good way - and it feels like it will be really warm. the black has a velvety look to it. i'm smitten. i should also mention that it did feel cropped to me - i know i read other reviews that said it wasn't cropped. i fee	1
Great for lounging or running errands. can be dressed up or down. i found them to run at least a size large though.	1
I love design of this top! it will look beautiful on many body types. the black material is thin, and for my personal level of comfort i will definitely wear a cami under. the details are gorgeous and the neutral colors easy to combine with casual or dressy bottoms. the top ran true to size for me.	1
Fit is perfect! very flattering. they are very long, so i will need to shorten.	1
The yellow is not as bright as the pic and the tee shirt base color is more off white/oatmeal making the shirt look much more drab in person than in the pics. fit was ok but nothing special about this and will be returning.	0
Exactly as pictured. great and lightweight for summer but long enough with the cowl neck to layer for colder seasons. so comfy and easy.	1
"I was so excited to try this dress, but after ready the reviews,i though they were all over the place! i descided to order my typical retailer size small. i'm 5'6"" , 134 lbs, and wear a size 6. well, it was a snug fit! i have a slim build and this was just to snug for my taste. i imagine a medium would have been better. however, i was very surprised by the length and slit... the dress hit at my knee cap with the slit going all the way up to mid thigh... .!?? i've seen pics of this dress on instagr"	1
"Cute suit over all. cups are lightly padded, which is nice if you're concerned about modesty. it runs really small in my opinion. i am 5'7"" and 125 lbs. i almost always wear a size small, but i ordered a medium in this suit, and although it fits and i'm sticking with the medium, i'm wondering if a large might fit even better. it's also too tight on the leg openings, in my opinion. i like that the straps are adjustable. the pattern is flattering, and i like the suit well enough to keep it. but i"	1
This dress is very lovely - ivory fits as pictured (slightly below knee) in ivory not as the black is depicted (much shorter). fits a little larger than expected and material is very stretchy.	1
Beautiful but big. i exchanged my 0 for a 00, and, oddly enough, there was no difference! had a similar experience with another 00 blouse. am i crazy, or is the 00 size just a sham?	1
As a dancer and yoga enthusiast i have tried my fair share of leggings. these are probably the best i've ever found. pure + good makes top quality, well fitting leggings that do not slide down, shift around, or become see-through regardless of the physicality of your movement. they breathe wonderfully and have survived one washing with no ill-effects. they are high enough in the rise that i never have to worry about revealing anything i don't want, nor do i constantly have to adjust them to keep	1
I ordered this dress in a petite but it arrived in a regular, the rest fit and in the meantime the petites ran out in my size.  the dress is too long but it is so beautiful i will get it shortened.  the fabric is lovely.  i am blonde and the green is so nice with my hair... which is a good thing since the other colour was totally sold out.  try not to miss out on this lovely purchase.....	1
Like a previous reviewer mentioned the jeans do not necessarily look like the one in the photo. i first ordered them in my regular size and also had to notice that they are cut like men's jeans with legs so skinny that i could only force them over my calves. the embroiding is beautiful, but it also stops the material from stretching, so the the super skinny legs are a real problem. also, they are not as intensely stone washed as shown in the picture. i decided to order them again one size bigger	0
I'm 5 feet tall, so dresses are hard to find for me. but, the petite sizes fit accurately. i'm very pleased with the dress!!!	1
Purchased the daisy sleep top to go with the matching shorts. i had been eyeing them for awhile in the store and so glad i took the plunge to get the set. i feel feminine and sexy as another reviewer noted while not being revealing (helpful for visitors and children :). i purchased a s as it does run a bit large.	1
Runs small. arms very short and hits in the wrong place across your chest. would not recommend.	0
This shirt is nothing like the online pictures. it's a stunner in person. ended up with the black one though i was torn between it and the white. i would agree with some other reviewers that it has little to no give across the chest so i bought a l due to broad shoulders. the m fit like a glove and i was afraid it might tear if i raised arms or reached for something. not sure if a large busted girl would be comfortable. though i sized up, it didn't affect the way it hangs and it hangs beautifull	1
These pants are as dreamy as linen but much more forgiving when worn all day. they fit true to size and are very flattering. i have 5 pair. they are my go to work pant that can be dressed up with an elegant tank if i have to run to dinner after work! love them	1
"Fyi to help with sizing i am 5'7"" weigh 134 lb and like things loose fitting but the medium was too big and sack like. dress is cute and the color is true to photo."	1
"I love this so so much. i'm 5'1"" with a short torso and post baby 34d boobs. the 6 petite is perfect. it's the first romper i found that fits me in the crotch, height, and leg area. so excited to wear this!"	1
This top fits perfect everywhere except the sleeves are a little tight. not uncomfortably so but i wish they had just a little more room so they looked like they did in the picture. other than that, i love this shirt! its super cute and comfy and i have gotten a few compliments on it!	1
This item is huge. i'm normally a medium, sized down to a small, still massive. couldn't go too much smaller because the buttons would pull at the chest. but the sleeves are very wide, as is the waist. way too much fabric. i had high hopes for this one but it just doesn't work. for reference i love billowy and flowy tops, but this was a tent.	0
"I read all the previous reviews and wasn't sure what to think. when i saw it on sale at my local retailer store, i decided that, despite the thin fabric, it was worth getting. i love the quote spoken by audrey hepburn in the movie ""sabrina"" and knew i just needed to add a cami underneath. i bought it two days ago and wore it yesterday with a short sleeved open sweater, so the quote showed. i got two compliments on it within a short time! for reference, i am 5'9"" and 150 lbs. i bought a large and i"	1
"Unlike one comment below a review on here who stated it felt childish, i didn't feel this way at all. i'm a sucker for anything white with tulle and soft colors and a bit of bling :) here's my thoughts: ------------------------- pros: - very soft with good amount of stretch. - tulle bottom is exactly as pictured. i disagree with another reviewer who said the color was more of taupe; it is not. this is pink/nude shade all the way. - runs tts. i'm a 36c, hourglass, 5'9"" and found the medium to be"	1
"I love this dress, but it is too short to keep. i am 5'8"" and weigh 124lbs. most of my cloths from retailer are either a size 4 or a small, but this dress is substantially shorter than other dresses purchased from retailer. it looks adorable on, but it is just too short (about 3 inches above my knees) to be considered professional enough to wear to work."	1
Really like this dress but..... the dress is lined in a heavy fabric and weighs a lot for a summer dress worst of all there is no chance at all of getting the buttons through the button holes. impossible! has to go back	0
"I thought this top was purely elegant. i'm 5'4"", and 135 lbs. i ordered a small and it fits perfectly. i thought the fabric was soft, but somewhat sheer on the top. it goes great with just about any pant."	1
I really wanted to love this waistcoat. i purchased this online and tried it on as soon as i received it. it runs large, but i should have realized the horizontal stripes sitting on the hips is not a good thing. the fur adds additional bulk where it is not needed, the hip area !!!!. i purchased a small and could have purchase a xs, but i think the problem would still be there in a smaller size. it's going back, but i am disappointed as i really wanted a something a little alternative !!!!!	0
Velvet always has made quality clothing and i had purchased the same shirt in another color and i wanted to see if they had other colors, they did and i got 2 more. i received in expected time and they were wrapped nicely. thank you for great choices of unique clothing.	1
I love this pajama combo! it is super cute and comfortable!	1
The pictures are not showing how absolutely spectacular this caftan is. it is very delicate (even says so on the tag) and lightweight so that you won't dread wearing it in the heat of the day. by what doesn't show up is that this caftan shimmers-there is gold string woven throughout the entire garment which gives it a slight sheen. it adds significantly to the impact of the garment, and i love this detail. i love the way this caftan drapes, and i love that it is longer than a normal caftan. the	1
You just need to be a little more careful but the unique popcorn stitch makes this an attractive statement sweater. i am 5'4 and 127 lbs and was a little surprised how cropped the cut on the size small was compared to how it appears on the photographed models.	1
"This top fits tts as shown on model. loose, flowy but the cut/details/flounce still give some nice shape. i usually take a s or m at retailer depending on the style/make. went with the small in this. i am 5'5"",narrow shoulders, ruler shape 34dd. no gaping in the front. fits gracefully flows with details that are classic and add the wow factor to this social or work appropriate top. so complimentary, it would flatter many body types. the neckline is juuuuussst right, i fasten the top button to make"	1
This dress hangs horribly. unlike the photo, the waist does not cinch. too bad. the colors are great and the quality of the material is nice. because i bought it on sale, i may try to tailor it to work, but unless you are willing to do that, its a no go. :-(	0
Cute jacket, but size didn't work on me. 5'4, 135 lbs. normally order s or xs in tops, but m in jackets. ordered the medium, but way too long everywhere. i can get by with regular a lot in retailer, but definitely ordering the petite to see if any better. not sure it will be enough though as arms were quite long.	1
This is a beautiful sweater. the color is not bright red, rather a dark coral. nonetheless it is much better looking in person than in the web photo. i only have one complaint which may be reason enough for me to return an otherwise perfect sweater. i wore this for approximately three hours today and could not believe the pilling under the arms and side of chest area. some pilling is normal and expected on any sweater but if this continues at the rate it appears to be going, i will contact retailer	1
"This dress is absolutely beautiful! i love the colors and design however there are two issues with the dress for my body style: 1. it's not made for busty girls. i'm a 34d/dd and the small would have fit well (i'm 5' 6"", 147 lbs.) but my chest did not fit. so i tried the medium but then the overall fit was worse, which led to another issue: 2. the waist and pleating made me look a little heavy because i still have a small amount of baby weight/spare tire around my waist, which was highlighted wi"	1
"I ordered a size 10 in the neutral motif and it fits perfectly and it looks great. i am 5'9"" 145lbs with 38"" bust. the sleeves are the perfect length. i couldn't be happier with this purchase."	1
"I debated for awhile about getting this dress. being tall i was worried that it would be really short on me, so i ended up ordering it in a large (i'm 5'10"" a size 10/12.) it definitely has a blousey look to it which i like. i kind of wish i had ordered it in a medium as well, but i think the large will work just fine. the length is good (hits right above my knee), the elastic waistband is nice because i can pull it up around my natural waist or pull it down for more of a drop waist effect. as o"	1
This top is a mix of materials - a silk and more of a t shirt material. i purchased for dressier wear but the material makes it more casual. i like the sale price so i'm keeping!  size down, runs a tad loose.	1
This is the cutest romper ever !! very high quality..  it has always been a challenge for me to find and love rompers. but this fit beautifully. i cant wait to wear it this summer.	1
This dress has a great design for any frame. it looks great with a belt to accentuate the waist but the dress stands great alone and doesn't require a lot of styling.	1
Got this today and highly recommend it! it fits perfectly and is very flattering! i can see wearing this all wear round! perfect date shirt!	1
I'm an xl in retailer blouses, and this blouse is the same. i'm guessing women with a thin frame might size down, but i can't say for sure. i purchased the white blouse with the floral pattern. there is a narrow band on the bottom, but it isn't tight, so i didn't find it to be a problem. i usually don't like blouses with banded bottoms, but this is loose. the band does cause the blouse to blouse out a bit, but the fabric has a really nice drape to it, so it worked fine. the fabric has a gre	1
120 lbs and i saw this while shopping with my sister who is 125 lbs. we both tried on the small and the fit was perfect. i didnot need a petite. it is so soft and i didnt notice other vests with different fabric from each other at all. the vest is just like the photo. its cozy. collar didn't bother me, i wear my top collar out or with a turtleneck. i waited until it was on sale because the price was a little high. but it is very soft and uniquely special.	1
These pants are so comfortable and i love the color, but they did not work for me.	1
"Fit is ""breezy"" which is what i expected. a little on the loose side but comfortable and still cute. the slip that accompanies the dress is of decent quality as well.  the back of the dress is not that much longer than the front, as in the picture, but i still liked the dress enough to keep it."	1
I can't say enough good things about this sweater. i bought it when it was full-price and it was totally worth it. it is incredibly soft and looks very sophisticated. i wish i could live in this sweater--given the color and my propensity to make a mess, i want to buy two more just in case!	1
Ordered this dress online, and i love it! i was looking for an understated but fun new years dress and this was exactly what i was looking for. the only minor qualm i had about the dress was that the velvet dots that hit where the seams met made the dress look puffier than it should some parts around the waist, but for the most part, the dress fit very well and was very flattering, may just need a little bit of ironing. i am 5'9 and usually am more conscious of how things fit around my hips, and	1
I carry my weight on my lower half, usually a large in bottoms. this one in a large was too big throughout especially since it doesn't have a waste band. returned.	0
The perfect flowy fall top! the material is thin so it may pick a little, but i love it.	1
Love another pair of ag stevie's!	1
"I don't know what it is about this top but i was so drawn to it when i saw it in the store. it's totally see through, that's the design and i think it's great. i wear a cami underneath but if you're more daring or you spend a lot of time by the beach, you can get away with a nude bra or bikini top. this definitely runs small. i'm 5'5"" 120 and usually wear xs/s but felt most comfortable in a medium. the body isn't tight or anything, it's just on the shorter side, especially if you have a longer t"	1
Thank you pilcro for making a skirt that is a great alternative to shorts or capris. i bought the green skirt and wore it on vacation. i realized a lighter color would be nice for summer, and ordered the light blue. it's tempting to get the red as well. the fit is great. i am 5'7 and the length is perfect. the skirt has weight. i am sure i will wear both of my skirts time and time again.	1
I'm so excited that retailer is bringing back some of the gorgeous fabrics and details they used to have. the all over embroidary is beautiful, the cotton/silk blend is delicious, and there's enough shaping that the top doesn't look too boxy. i did end up sizing down for a slightly more fitted loo and for a smaller armhole. i also picked through a couple of tops to find the one i wanted, since the embroidery pattern wasn't centered on some of them.	1
This was so boxy and unflattering. i loved the lining and the fabric was very soft but it looked like i was wearing a bag. was hoping to use this as a cute top layer for dresses but it was a terrible fit. sizing down would not help this one. went back!	0
I love this cotton weave shift dress. it is supposed to be loose and not tight. i purchased a medium and fits the way i see it should fit. ref: 34dd, 148 lb; 5'4 height. hits above the knee but office appropriate as not too short. i paired it with a few seasons ago, the navy blue suede fringe jacket by retailer elevenses; new necklace in the blue motif from retailer ( it has a hanging druzy pendant) navy hose and navy crew neck long sleeve top.  great outfit for work and an after work party at retailer	1
"After a long wait for this dress to come in. i finally received it! the wait was worth it! the colors and pattern are just like they are online. the length comes right to to the top of my knees...i am 5'7"". a couple of things to note: the sleeves are narrow,. if you have skinny arms, no problem. the fit across the bust is snug enough that if you have a large bust, there will probably be a gap at the buttons. there are gathers at the shoulder giving the sleeve a slight puffed shoulder. if you"	1
I bought this dress for fall and will get a lot of wear out of it! the fit is perfect - loose, but structured. plan to pair with booties over the coming months!	1
I absolutely adore peplum tops, although some of them are made for individuals with short torsos. this one is beautifully designed with a long torso and flowing wrists. there is a nice balance between the fitted torso and then the flowing peplum and sleeves. the best thing of all is the fabric, which is a stretchy mid-weight jacquard. it is easy to get on, with a zipper in the back. i am sure i will get a lot of use out of this as the weather turns cooler and i plan on pairing it with pencil ski	1
I snagged this top with the 25% off sale and it's adorable. i got the white, and it goes great with some skinny jeans or tucked into a skirt. i found it ran true to size. my only complaint is that like some other reviewers have stated, it does wrinkly very easily. and i would say for full price i don't think the quality is worth the cost, but on sale, it's a great shirt.	1
"I'm barely 5'4"" and rarely find a maxi that isn't far too long or the other extreme. i prefer mine to just barely reach the ground as opposed to rising 5 inches from the floor for example. this one is perfect with flat sandals. i tried on the 4 and chuckled b/c it was 6"" too long. tried on the 2 and not only was it the perfect length, the bodice fit like a glove. i would say i'm average bust size, always fluctuating but not generally flat-chested. i prefer more conservative sleeveless dresses an"	1
I liked this sweater in the picture but was less impressed when i saw it in the store. it looked a bit odd and perhaps cheap to me. still i decided to leave it on my wish list and got it as a christmas gift. once i tried it on, i really liked the way it looked and felt! it's flattering, comfortable and looks great with jeans! it's really cozy! i rated it tts but you could almost size down on it.	1
"I love these pants, but they are a bit too long. like the reviewer below, they hit me right at the ankles. i am 5'6"". i am going to hem them a bit. also they were a little bigger in the waist than expected--could have ordered a size 28 instead of a 29."	1
Fits great, not too tight/baggy. pattern on shirt is pretty and should work for layering or wearing on its own.	1
"Very flattering. fits tts. love the colors. does not give any lift up or support to breasts.i am a 36 c and i was fine with this. it is so flattering to back and overall a flattering fit i was ok with my breast not being supported and uplifted. if you want support this is not for you. it does look exactly as it does on model in regard to coverage showing some cleavage but very little. i am 5'6"" 127 lbs and not very fit and took a medium. my husband really loves this suit and gave it two big thum"	1
I love this dress!! it has a beautiful european flair, and more beautiful in person. i don't agree with the other reviewers that its see through-the fabric is a good quality, and thicker than you would think. the variable length is the best part of the dress. the color looks beautiful with a tan summer glow!	1
Super flattering fit. i am generally a large, large, and the medium of this shirt fit really well. the drape of the fabric was very forgiving of my tummy. great look. also my 1 year old son loves the colors and flowers!	1
I tried this on in the store, and the fabric is lovely - so, so soft and drapey. the skirt is very flattering - good length. but the zipper! the zipper was already ripped away from the fabric, so i wasn't able to purchase it. such a shame.	1
Looks great on. fits beautifully,	1
When i saw this online, it looked like a regular cardigan with a hood, but with looser arms and a generally looser fit. just be aware it has bat wings or something (not sure what it is called). there isn't one picture included with an arm lifted, so without a really close look, the arms look loose, but normal. i returned it :(	1
Very cute shirt, but the white is see through. i could see every detail on my bra. i returned for the pink, which is just as cute.	1
Oh my this is the best cardigan ever. quality is superb and so soft. i am between a 12 and 14 so i ordered the xl, this cardigan fits true to size. will order more if more colors become available.	1
This top immediately caught my eye in the store.  not only that, it was the pink color and i don't usually gravitate towards pink.  i live in a warm weather area so i can get good use of these tops year round.  i say tops because i bought a second top in the green a couple days later.  you can definitely see your bra when you raise your arms but this top is just so soft and breezy.	1
Got for a mother  day gift.  think  she will like it because she always at the beach and is very happy go lucky new mother.	1
The material that was used to make this top is very thin and poor quality. it feels like the type of material that will disintegrate after one wash. i normally wear an xl and this top is huge and not flattering. returning asap.	0
I got this in the green blue pink motif and i love it. really nice flow and not tent like at all. 5'8, 135, and in a size 6 i don't find this shows my stomach at all. it's really comfortable and i love the colors. i did get this in store at 15% off and i think it's a little pricy for a rayon shirt without the discount.	1
Nice light weight fabric, drapes well.  awesome detailing.  have worn twice already with lots of compliments.	1
"I like the colors, material and style of this sweater but not a fan of the sizing.  the xs/s was far too short for me and the m/l was great in length but had a tremendous amount of extra volume.  i am 5'/6"" size 8."	0
I love this tank! basic but super sexy! i'm an a cub and this tee makes them look a lil bigger so i'll take it!! i bought the dark grey in small and went back for the striped grey and purchased small. i bought the black one too but i feel like the small in black is too big and the xsmall is too small. i'm torn because i want the black to tuck in a pencil skirt.	1
Beautiful dress. i just wore this dress for my wedding. it was a beautiful wedding dress and i got many compliments on the uniqueness and the beading detail. there was one really big problem. the beads and the flowers kept falling off. i sat down and stood up leaving a pile of little flowers and beads. i could be standing still and they would periodically drop off. it was kind of embarrassing and everyone remarked that i was my own flower girl. i am still finding pieces of the dress everywhere.	1
So the other review complained that there are slits on the sleeves of this blouse. yes, that is true. however, i love that about this blouse! i tried this blouse on in the store so the slits were not a surprise to me, but i can understand how they may upset a customer who wasn't expecting them. i think the slits are elegant and are in no way obtrusive or revealing. you could totally still wear this blouse to work or a nice dinner. i love it because its unique enough to be worn alone and simple i	1
I love the desi blouse! i got it in white and it's a little more off white than pure white, but it is a great flowy top. the touch of lace across the bust is a nice accent. the only down fall is that the sleeves are a bit puffy, but the rest of the top makes up for that.	1
This suit fits like a glove! i've had five kids and am currently nursing my last baby so i was looking for a suit to wear to the beach this summer when i'm just not feeling a bikini. this is it! it's comfortable and not binding easy to nursing and swim in. overall worth the extra splurge. i'm tall too so it was plenty long on my torso.	1
I absolutely adore this cardigan. it's very feminine, stylish, and comfortable and the gold color is gorgeous. i received numerous compliments when i wore it to work the first time. it's the perfect weight for transitional weather or chilly offices.	1
"This is beautiful and fits perfect. it's even prettier in person, and extremely comfortable and high quality. i'm 5'3"" and it hits right above the knee. the straps are adjustable and fits true to size. i bought an xs and it fits perfect. must buy for a sweet little night gown!"	1
I got the grey in my normal size large and it fits as shown. love the cowl neck although it's a bit awkward and oversized. the cowl is a lighter shade of grey and a nice contrast. it felt a bit itchy and is a tad boxy and short. i decided to return.	1
I ordered a size 6 and an 8 based on the review that said that the piece ran small. i fit both skirts but chose the size 8 as it was a bit looser at the hip and the length was better. funny though-the pockets on both skirts were sewn at very uneven areas on both. neither skirt had usable pockets as they were sewn shut at half inch intervals on one skirt (6), and very uneven intervals on the other (8). i liked the idea of pockets which is one reason i ordered it-it is described as having side poc	1
Fit great with moving room. colors very vibrant. just right for a house with lots of cool air conditioning!	1
This top is made from a thick, sweatshirt-type fabric, making it a nice choice for transitional weather. the details are quite unusual and lovely. i just got it and i've already worn it twice.	1
These are the cutest prints, but the cute simply doesn't work for me. this is longer than the conversationalist shirt, which is an improvement as far as i'm concerned. nevertheless, both my appropriate size, which i still felt was too short, and the size up, which hit at a flattering spot, were twice as wide as as my midsection. so while the arms and shoulders seem true to size, the shirt runs very wide.	0
This is the most comfortable dress ever! it's so soft. i typically wear a size small and this fits true to size. it is long enough to wear to work, which i love. it looks great w flats in the summer and it's going to look great w boots!	1
"This top is perfect! i'm 5'9"" and a medium build, and it's hard to find tops that have long enough sleeves. this is really long! i love the weight of the fabric - perfect under a coat and heavy enough for cool texas winter days. the fabric is really soft and the color is a blue-ish grey. the style is feminine but not too girlie. it's my new go to top!!"	1
A little boxy but will be a go to basic. the off set ruffle gives interest	1
This poncho is dreamy. the colors are divine and appear a little bolder in person. there is a gorgeous leather trim around the edges that elevates the look so much. the belt minimizes how big the poncho is and really makes it feminine. its everything you dream of when it comes to a third layer for fall. my only gripe is that the fabric is a little itchy. it being wool i can't say that i'm surprised and the truth is that its heavy enough that you would definitely be wearing long sleeves underneat	1
I saw army green pants similar to this in the store, but then found these on line and ordered them instead. i love them. they stretch out a bit so i am glad i sized down. i could possibly have sized down even one more size. i got a 27. the waist is very comfortable, so maybe this is just the fit...after all, they are basically stylish fatiques. either way, they are casual but on trend. i have planned a ton of outfits in my head already because these pants will go with so much! i think the cuff w	1
I held my breath as i slid this on for the first time right out of the package; the size 8 was perfect for me (usual medium, size 8, short-waisted, 34f)! this blouse is truly a find: luxurious linen in a unique, appealing design, excellent fit (the pleat at the back gives nice room to make the fit just right, the v-neck is not too deep (thankfully bra friendly!), the slightly lower back length is stylish but not extreme, and finally, admirable craftsmanship. i highly recommend! this will feel di	1
Wanted a cooler weather casual weekend errand dress and this is very confortable to wear with artistic leggings and tall boots. pockets are always handy and it is easy to style with a contrast scarf or long necklace. for added warmth can add a full slip or wear alone in spring with sandals. received numerous compliments wearing the first time, so purchased the navy one several weeks later. anticipate wearing these dresses often and when the cotton finally wears down will use as a nightgown. love	1
"This is a nice sweater. very soft and while cardigans are not normally flattering on me, i found this one to be slimming. for reference i am 170 lbs 5'8"" and a size medium or 10."	1
I got the green motif color which is really multi color: blue, orange, purple, yellow, green and brown. the fabric is gauzy and sheer, nice and breezy for summer. there is a subtle stitching detail at the shoulders. i ordered my usual size, medium, and it fits well in the shoulders and arm holes, but it is extremely billowy in the body. i had to take it in a couple inches on each side to make it a little less full. it's still has some swing, but not quite as much as before.	1
I got this in the grey and wore it the day i opened the package. one side is see through, so i wore a camisole underneath. it's lightweight and not at all clingy. i normally like my shirts in medium and this was true to size for me. perfect sweater for a fall day in new england.	1
This is the best item i have gotten form retailer. the quality is amazing. soft, covers my butt, classic piece!!!	1
I was so excited to purchase this dress for my masters graduation party. it looks beautiful on but i could not get over one little detail. the structure of the top falls funny on your chest - a bit too high from the rest of the pulled fabric. it doesn't look right. if you have a necklace that falls perfectly on the piece of fabric, like the main photo shown, you are good. the third photo with the short necklace shows this issue best.	0
Great casual top with flare. looks cute with grey pilcro stet jeans. flattering with peplum in back. nice cut for shoulders and neckline.	1
I found this dress to be very short waisted, much closer to an empire waist than shown in the picture. it was also an inch or two longer in the skirt than other maxi dresses i've gotten from retailer. it really could have used those inches above the waist. just a strange fit overall.	0
This was my go to dress this past summer. so easy to wear and pair with cute wedges. perfect to dress up or down.	1
Saw this skirt in the store, but the size was wrong. i am normally a 0 or 2 at retailer, but i was afraid that the 2 would be just too much material, so i ordered the 0, and boy, am i glad. elegant, can go from day to night with the right shoes and accessories. anticipating many compliments.	1
This top is perfect for wanting that fall/winter look in warmer climates. the slits on the sides allow for a lot of movement and turtleneck is just right. i love wearing it with my paige bell canyon flairs and some clogs! my only thing i wish was that it was cut in so much at the top, as how you can see at the model's armpit, wish that part was a little wider it would be a bit more flattering. otherwise great top, i have it in black and been thinking about getting it in the orange color too!	1
"This fits tts.  it is body-hugging as shown on the model.  the knit is thin, soft with tons of stretch.  i bought the ""navy"" which is the color shown in the photo.  as you can see, it's not really navy.  it's a strange blue that's more like a faded dark mallard blue.  but, it's still blue. the sleeves are long on me. so you taller girls won't have issues.  the ruffles move and are so fun.  the fabric, however, is not finished off.  it's raw cut material, which is why i gave it 4 stars."	1
Love this tee. it has a drapery cut which i love. the only thing i found was that it ran a bit smaller.	1
I see all the amazing reviews and on one hand, i agree with them. but these pants do run huge and they don't fit tailored like on the model. on me, they fit loose around the legs and thighs and they're super wrinkly. you'll have to iron these after every wear and every wash. i'm surprised to see the comment saying they're wrinkle resistant. they aren't. also, the kahki is more grey which i don't love. i got these on sale, but even at $50 i just can't justify keeping them. they're super comfy but	0
I love the unusual print, but the cut didn't work for me. i've got a round back side and a sway back, and the dress made me look twice as big front to back than i actually am because there's no shaping to help it adjust to the curves. so sad!	1
Usually wear s and xs, tried this in s at store but the sides were still lumpy after zipping the size zipper up. if i tried xs it would have looked better but may be bit too tight. the sides of the arm holes were also cut very low. it also has a dusty grey sheen to it that makes it look like old velvet in a bad way. two layers, green on outside, and a polyester beige layer underneath. but definitely a showpiece that can be paired with a short jacket.	0
This runs way big, i'm a size 8, purchased the medium. it's just big with no shape.	0
I found this dress on sale recently in store and it was in my size- a 2p! i tried it on and it fits perfectly for my 34 d and 5ft frame. since i found it in store and it is an older dress, there are some frays in the threading (probably from being shipped, handled, etc). i still bought it for the sale price. i look forward to wearing it out!	1
I absolutely love this product! it is so versatile and i can wear it up or dress it down. absolutely perfect paired with leggings to sit in classes all day :)	1
"I was really hoping to like this, but it did not look the way it does on the model, at least not on me. the sharkbite hem is much more pronounced and looser. the one in the photo looks like it was pinned back. i am 5'8"" and usually wear a medium or large. i got a medium and there was a lot more material on the bottom half than the photo shows. it made me look bigger and was not flattering. material has a nice weave but it's thin and delicate. i bought the (holly) deep olive and the blue. colors"	0
I was so excited to get this! the fabric is beautiful - comfy soft and a great wash/print of blue. it reminded me of the ocean. however, the fit was off. the waist was too high, the length too short, and the straps to long. i was very disappointed. i considered taking it to the tailor before returning. ultimately, i decided to return.	0
I love the way these jeans look and fit, but they have a chemical smell. i assumed the odor would go away after i washed them, but it doesn't seem to have helped.	0
This is a lovely jacket. it is easily paired with different bottoms and tops, and is such a fun take on the standard blazer with the beautiful ruffle pocket-detail. they are not actual pockets though, which i thought would have been an easy thing to incorporate. my chief issue with the fit is that it is a tad boxy. i am a standard xs/xxs and this runs just a tad big and a bit wide. but unbuttoned it falls seamlessly. if you use the clasp, it actually looks bigger. regardless, i love it and was o	1
This jacket is surprisingly soft and comfy. i'd been debating getting a leather jacket in this style but when i saw this it seemed a great option. seems to be very versatile.	1
Ugh. this skirt is beautiful and so well made, but i sized up to a 0 from my usual 00 based on reviews, and it's too large, and now my size is all sold out! if it were the right size it would fit beautifully! i'm pretty much a stick, (5'5, 105lbs) and it does poof out at the hips, making me look a little curvier, which might be an issue for some. but the quality is amazing, and this piece will spruce up most outfits !	1
I got this in the color listed as pink. it's not a usual pink. the fit is good--not too tight and not too loose. the length is good for a tee.	1
This is such a cute top. i like it both off and on the shoulder. easily tucked or left out depending how you want to style it.	1
This sweater runs oversized; very soft and comfortable and colors are spot on for fall. love the sleeve length.	1
I ordered  flora nikrooz for my daughter for her wedding.  it is beautiful. the delivery was quick!!! very happy.	1
I was so excited to try this on in the store, because i've had my eye on it online. unfortunately, it is not like the picture. the material is very thin, almost translucent. i also could not figure out how it get it on! the cape has short sleeves, not long, as it appears in the picture, and the folds of fabric would not drape quite right in the front. love the look of black design on white. hopefully retailer can redo this in a thicker cape for the fall, but for now, i'll skip this one.	0
Oh such a classic retailer look for summer! a vintage pattern on a crisp cotton fabric. i was immediately drawn to it. but wait- there is a sort of wrap around tie at the waist, creating the look of an apron. yes. it looks like one is wearing a full apron. or scrub dress.  why?? this would have been sooo much better as a simple shift or a skirt/blouse combo.	0
Cute style, flowy fabric. it runs big i purchased a medium and could've definitely gotten a small.	1
Great transitional top.  comfy and great fit.  i like my tops to be somewhat roomy and this was great in a small.  i usually buy medium.	1
Love these jeans, comfortable fit and material is soft.. fit true to size and have a good rise.	1
This blouse was so cute, i really wanted to love it. as others mentioned, there is something wrong with the fit. i'm not a large person, but the top was tight even though i ordered a medium and a small.	0
I just loved this online and love it in person. so feminine and delicate. just perfect for summer get togethers.	1
I had originally bought this top in one of your stores and loved it!!! got sooo many compliments!!! while reading my e-mail one night, i saw it on sale!! of course i would have bought it anyway!!! now i have 2 of my favorite tops!!!	1
I bought this tank on a whim without trying it on in the store, in black. the detail on the front is cute and the peplum is really cute without being frumpy at all. i am usually a small, ocassionally a medium in retailer shirts and i bought this in small. it fits but i feel like i could have gone up to a medium, it's just a little tight across the chest, but i do have more broad shoulders than most so maybe it's just because of that. the fabric is nice and stretchy, so i might be able to get away	1
What a flattering top! great with jeans or shorts. i'm a sz12 and l was perfect for me. love the colors - got lots of comments.	1
I had been eying this dress online for a while and when it finally came into stores i was so excited! this dress is so gorgeous and very flattering on my body. i love the bottom of it, it is more of a u cut in the front and square in the back. add an ada wrap belt and perfection!	1
I ordered these in white and sized down from my normal 28 to 27 based on reviews and they are too small. i've seen with other pants/shorts that sizing can be off with different colors, so i'm guessing it's the same case here. i'll try ordering again in my usual 28 and hope that they will be a good fit. otherwise, nice shorts for the price.	1
"This dress did end up working out for me. however i am very narrow in my chest and shoulders and i can see how it would be too tight on anyone with a med-lrg chest and/or broad shoulders. the fabric is light weight, nice for summer. it will need to be ironed and will wrinkle easily but it still looks well made to me. the slip is smaller than the dress but i feel that the dress is supposed to be ""drapey"". i kept it."	0
Received many compliments the first day i wore them.. amazing fit. disagree with the other post. the quality is amazing. i wish they had other colors. bought xs	1
Let me talk about the fit. i am a size 6 petite. i weigh 120 and am 5' tall. i am curvy and have short legs. what little height i have is in my torso. that being said, i ordered the 6p and the 6. no doubt about it! the 6p fits like a 4p. the 6p was tight in the hips and thighs. the size 6 regular was a perfect fit. if you want the pant to have s cropped look like in the picture then order up a size and stay in petite. so i would have ordered a 8p i'd i wanted the cropped look like in the pic. bu	1
The print was what attracted me to this dress. and the material is soft and comfortable. however, the fit was all wrong for me. it had a great belt in the back, but hung very loosely in the front. it reminded me a little of some of my maternity dresses. maybe sizing down would have helped, but then i feared it wouldn't fit my hips right. this dress may look better on someone who isn't as curvy. it really looks great on the model, but not on me.	0
I tried this product in store in red and fell in love with the fit, it fits in the most beautiful flattering way, red looked gorgeous - rich glossy fabric, this could easily be one of those effortless summer transition pieces that can go from a day dress into incredible sexy night outfit. the fabric was very lush and had this rich gloss to it, i have never seen a fabric like that, it almost looked coated. red being such a statement piece was a bit too much for me, so i decided to order the produ	1
I love this dress. the pockets are great and the fabric is very soft and similar to other cloth and stone garments. i also love it's made in the usa. my only wish is that the chambray version was as great. (it's not - the pockets are cut bad, it's cut smaller in the chest, and made in china)	1
The uniqueness of this top caught my eye online. i normally wld not want a long sleeve top in the summer. a bit warm to wear outside now but i like the casual but unique style of it. it's a top i can wear now but only indoors with a/c. the regular small fits fine. a little oversized & sleeves a little long - as in the pic. the color/style/detaling is exactly as in the pic - no surprises. soft & comfy. a little opaque but a nude bra will work fine. i don't see the need for a tank/cami under it. i	1
"I ordered this dress in a xs petite. i am 5'0"" 105 lbs. the plaid looks more drab in person and the fit was very frumpy. the wrap style is typically flattering but on this dress, the dress tied above my natural waist and the fit made my hips appear larger. i was pretty disappointed in this little number and will be sending it back. it might work on taller people, like the model, but i would steer clear if you are a petite."	0
Bought this for the beautiful fabric and easy fit which it has. fits nicely through the shoulder area and is a little on the baggy side in the legs but the draping fabric makes up for that. i bought it in petite small and it is definitely long enough for a dress.	1
Love everything about this dress -- i ordered the 'red' which is more of a 'red orange' / with cream and beige - as pictured, colors are beautiful. the dress has a nice 'drape' / great feel, love it !	1
"I was hoping to wear this dress on my wedding day before the ceremony. i'm 5'5"", 130 pounds, usually wear a 6. i ordered this dress in medium and it hangs off of me. it is not straight as it looks on the model, but bells out from the waist. the sleeves are so long that they covered my fingers."	0
"Quality jumpsuit but poor design. the green made me look a bit like ""gumby the cartoon character"""	0
Love this soft sweatshirt. the peplum makes it a little different and the quality is great. go to piece for spring. loose fitting but true to size in shoulders.	1
Didn't notice the zipper in the back when i ordered this so it was a nice surprise	1
I am a teacher and love finding cute, comfortable clothes. i wore this for the first time today and got compliments all day long! i felt so stylish, and i was still able to do what i needed to do!	1
I loved the shirt. the fabric was amazing and i loved the way it fit, unfortunately it didn't look good on me. but i would recommend this shirt to anyone who can pull it off the look, i was sad i couldn't.	1
I love this top so much i bought it in 3 colors. the material is so soft and comfortable. has a slight fitting in the waist to make it very flattering. you can wear the next as pictured or button it up and slouch it and it looks great both ways. perfect with jeans or dress it up with slacks. just wish it wasn't dry clean only.	1
I'm a pretty solid 10 these days (and had no trouble fitting into other size 10 dresses at the store). the large was so tight around my hips. i barely got it on. they didn't have an xl to try on, but i can't imagine i would have fit in it. so, if you have wide hips, this is not the dress for you. it fit fine on top in the l, it was just so tight in the hips that it did not lay nicely.	0
"Another reviewer said it best, ""i love the way this dress makes me feel."" i couldn't agree more. the lines are perfect and effortless.  with all the different reviews on size, i went into the store to try it on. i am usually always a s or m at retailer and a s fit perfectly. i think sizing down any more takes away from the casual look of the dress. i am 5' 5"", 130, and have a small bust."	1
"I liked this dress, but had some issues. i am 5' 3"" and a 34 d. with small shoulders. the dress was way too big in the shoulders in the 6 i usually wear, so just hung on me funny. otherwise i really liked it. if it weren't for the way it fit me on top (not an unusual problem if you are large busted but have small shoulders) meant i had to return it."	1
Not sure about this yet. reordered larger size because it hits much higher than shown. belly peeked out from under it! ordered 6 and i'm normally a small/6. like the design but really short.,	1
I bought this top to wear this fall, and it does not disappoint. it's a heavier light knit and the pattern is subtle but really pretty. i ordered a size smaller than i usually wear so that i can wear it on or off the shoulder, making this great for work.	1
This blouse is just so beautiful! but i do love white blouses, so that may influence my enthusiasm. however, once i buttoned it up, it was just dreamy. i have a long torso and am tall for a typical xs, so it's often hard to find something that's the right length. this is perfect! it may overwhelm some ladies who are on the petite side of height, but it's a rare find for me. paired with a pair of cropped pants because i'd come in a dress, it looks delightfully vintage in the best of ways. i'm sti	1
I most often fit into a size medium. based on prior reviews, i ordered this dress in a small and it fits perfectly. it drapes nicely. the fabric is soft and flows well. the under layer has a nice little stretch to it. the dress looks good with and without the belt. my favorite and most-slimming look is to just tie cinch and tie it in the back, such that it does not wrap around the front at all. the dress is so comfortable and the neckline is very flattering. no bra needed for my small bust.	1
The colors of this top are perfect for spring, i love the embroidery and like the sleeves with the ties at the bottom. what i didn't like and primary reason i may be returning, is the elastic bottom. it cuts off at an awkward spot on my waist and makes my top section look short and wide. i am very disappointed about this, as the rest of the blouse is gorgeous.	0
Tried this dress on today in the store. i am a size 10, sometimes a size 8. the size 12 was the first size i tried that zipped all the way up. however it was still very tight around my stomach and bust. and then from having to size up, it flared out too much at the bottom for my liking	0
This top is super cute and comfy! just wish they would have made more xl's - ran out fast! i am 5'10 and usually wear an 8-10 top in retailer, so i purchased a large in this top to get the length and look of the model in the picture. it was too short and didn't fall like the picture, i tried to exchange for the xl and it was already sold out! bummer! was looking forward to wearing this all summer! 4 stars for running out of a size so quickly! please make more!!	1
I tried on a regular size at the store, and definitely need petite (5'1.5', 115 lbs). the dress is comfrotbale, and the ivory color gives it a victorian feel. the sleeves are nice a cover the shoulder in a flattrering spot, where hte muscles meet. there is alining, so not see-through. length was too long, why i need petie, also loose-fitting, i would like it more a little more fitted, jsut a bit.	1
This casual top is adorable! a great top for jeans, linen pants or shorts! it would be cute with skirts too.  i love the heavy feel of the fabric. too many fabrics today are thin and/or clingy. this is soft, but is substantial. it works well on my body-type. tall, thin, without much figure. it's not cheap, but something i'll likely keep for a few years.	1
I love this skirt; but it is so long that i have ordered the petite as well to see which one i will keep. i am tall; but even pulled up higher than my waist, there is at least 3 inches too much in length and i want to wear a flat shoe or boot with it. if i keep this one, it will need to be altered.  it has pockets which i love. it is an effortless long skirt which i will wear christmas day for sure. the pattern is stunning with the mixed prints. the fabric is silky. it can be dressed down with a	1
I love this! great quality and flattering. i'd definitely agree that it runs true to size, as i had to size up because it was the only size available, and it is a little large in the stomach and rear, but it works well in the chest area. the v neck isn't too low and the sides provide good coverage up top. also, it covers the rear end well! material is nice and thick and the seams are good quality. super happy with this purchase, just wish it was in stock in the smaller size so it held me in more	1
This blouse is so pretty. i love the long tie. the pattern is very unique. it is a thin, light weight fabric so you can easily wear it underneath a leather jacket.	1
Feels great, flows nicely, and love the pockets that hide pretty much everything from a lipstick container to a phone.	1
"Size 2p is perfect for me (32a, 25"" waist, and 32"" hip) with a lot of room left for a big dinner. the design is exceptionally creative and attractive, and the fabric is of very high quality."	1
I love love love this swimsuit! yes it's a bit pricey for a bathing suit, but i love the design and colors and the back detailing is sexy yet not all that revealing. i can't wait to wear it in hawaii next month! the only part to be careful about is not to stretch it too much when putting it on and taking it off, i can see the diamond cutouts stretching or even ripping if pulled too hard by accident. overall a great swimsuit for the summer!	1
This top is beautiful but beware there is a lot of extra material on the sides. it was not flattering on only because of all the excess fabric. clearly the model in the picture has it pinned behind her. it would be a keeper if it was cut closer to the body but sadly it's going back.	0
I ordered this dress when it was briefly on sale with an extra percent off. i was very excited to receive it in my usual size large, and wear with a jean jacket and cowboy boots. when i took it out of the package, i could tell it looked really small. i didn't even try it on. i had my daughter who wears a size small try it on, and she couldn't even get it over her hips. if you are tall and thin like the model, it will work for you. it is made of cupro, looks exactly like the photo, the color is g	1
"This is one of the best things i've ever purchased at retailer. it's comfortable, stylish, and flattering. i ordered it in black, and i'm now ordering the green as well. i usually wear small in the dolan line, and this is no exception. i am 5'2"", 135 lbs, athletic build, and the regular small fits perfectly."	1
"Love this dress. i think i scored the deal of the year with this one. found it in my local retailer store. it had been in my ""save for later"" forever but i couldn't bring myself to pay full price... then it sold out in my size online. i was in my local store browsing the new items on sale with the additional 40% off, and there it was 1, and only 1. and my size.... i picked it up, noticed the cut outs that are not very apparent in the online photos, but it back, picked it back up, put it back....."	1
Better than the picture, right chest neck line not too low. comfortable material and the cut is just right. bought two in different color.	1
I got this shirt in black, and it's perfect for the office. i ordered a medium, which i thought was a little on the larger side. well made, the details make it an interesting top.	1
I had to return this because the lining is super short and uneven. its shorter in the back and falls weird. i love the color even better than the picture. but quality is lacking for this high price. i ordered the 4 petite and it fit but the elastic waist shows any bump in your tummy too. bummer	0
These are the perfect dressy 'jeans'. they are super soft but have the right amount of structure. they sit higher on the waist, which is one reason they are so flattering. the other reason is the flared, long leg! very long, in fact. i'm 5'5, 130 lbs and ordered a size 28. they fit me perfectly but i do have to wear them with my tall heels - which makes them perfect for work, with pumps as well as for casual outfits with tall wedges. if my size wasn't sold out, i'd order another pair - they are	1
From the picture i wasn't sure how it would fit. got in the mail and i love it. fits snug when you first put it on and get looser as you wear it. definitely should of gotten a large.	1
Love this top, it looks just as pictured. the lilac color is just as it looks, which i am happy about. sometimes this shade ends up darker than it appears online, but not with this top. it is soft velvet, silky lining and hits right where it does on model. i got a pxs my usual size. i am 5'3. the neck is a bit tight once buttons are buttoned up, but again this is pictured. well made and very pretty. can dress up or down.	1
"I love this dress. the pattern is fun, the style is relaxed and breezy for spring/summer, and it is well-made. a steal at the sale price! also, it has pockets :) a huge plus for me. since it is a loose-fitting style, i would say it run just a tad big. i bought the s petite and i am 5'4"" 115lbs. i could've gone xs petite ...but the s fits well and looks great. the pattern is stunning. a great addition to my summer wardrobe. i thought about pairing it with a fitted white pant, but it hits me right"	1
I am 5ft 8in and about 140lbs-athletic busty build. i normally wear a size 4-6. i ordered this dress in white in a size 6 and couldn't be more pleased! i actually hopped online today to try to order another in the lilac but they are unfortunately sold out. this dress is exactly as pictured-the upper back is fitted, keeping it from going out too much and looking like a straight up tent. i adore it and hope that they will re-stock it!	1
The print on this dress is gorgeous---but the material does not stretch whatsoever, and there are not zippers or buttons to ease in the fit. i always, always, always wear a size zero. it was a massive struggle to even get the dress over my head and on to my body. i felt like i was getting crushed! once on, although awfully small, the dress is just beautiful in every way. so chic! i just returned it and ordered two sizes up---here's hoping it fits!	1
I love this dress!!! it's comfortable, flattering and stylish. looks great with flats or boots - awesome with a chunky scarf and tights.	1
This is one of those you can tell from the hanger that it's not going to work. too boxy. too short. and the girlish ruffle makes it look like an over-sized child's shirt that got all messed up in the washing machine.	0
Nice top; the material is soft and drapey. i like to wear it layered under a shorter shirt or jacket.	1
"These jeans fit great, but i think getting the right size is key. i bought my usual denim size 26 and at first i thought they were too tight. but as the day wore on, they softened and conformed to my body and fit like a glove. if i bought them in a larger size, i'm afraid they'd bag out like jeans tend to do. i think it's the ""legging"" style that makes them so form fitting. i wish they were ankle length like on the model, but i'm 5'5"" and they are quite a bit longer on me than the model."	1
I saw this online yesterday and i was in the store today to try it on. i assumed it would look average or below average on me and i could just walk away no problem. by no means am i in the financial bracket to be spending this much money on a jumpsuit, yet here i am at home wearing it as i write this review. it is surprisingly flattering. i am 5 feet tall and have a petite frame so wide leg pants never work on me, but this somehow did without making me look bulky. given my height, it comes to ab	1
I saw these paired with the denim swing tank in the store and was inspired by the nautical look! the fit was a little snug. i am between a 4-6 in pants and definitely had to go with the 6, and even that was a little tight. for reference i am 5'6 and 125 lbs, curvy on bottom. the sales lady said they will stretch and there is some give to them, but i don't anticipate a lot of stretch. they are slim fitting all the way down and are flattering to the rear. i think they look better in person than on	1
Soft fabric. great color for fall and sophisticated detail at waist, sleeves. a keeper!	1
"These leggings are great because they are comfortable, stylish and can be dressed down or up. great pair of fun leggings to wear. i'm 5""3' and 180 and so i'm not a skinny girl, but they are flattering on me. i love them!"	1
Cute, basic white shirt with nice detail. i love meadow rue and this is another great shirt from them. while i love it, i wish it were just a little bit softer (i am a sucker for soft things). however, i am keeping the shirt and it will be great for work or play.	1
I really liked this top, but it was very expensive even when on sale, and it ended up being boxy. i am flat-chested (32a), 5'7'. if i remember correctly, i tried on the xs. it was cute, but it wasn't flattering because it was so boxy on my frame. perhaps it'd be more flattering on other body shapes. i think it would be cuter if it was a bit more fitted. otherwise, the quality seemed great, though i'd be worried about all the beading falling off eventually.	1
Great top! very easy to wear. looks great with jeans or dressier pants.	1
Just received these this morning and so happy. cartonnier always makes a substantial quality product. might run a little large,depends how roomy you want them, lovely colors and perfect length. wish they came in other colors.	1
Admittedly, i ignored this dress on a few trips to my local retailer and then it went on sale, practically begging me to give it attention. i tried it on and fell in love! so feminine, light, and comfortable.  it has a sort of roman/boho goddess vibe due to the billowy top, especially in the lighter greige with some sea-hued accessories added but not so much it feels like cosplay or something. i have a full bust (dd) and didn't find this dress to be unflattering. after wearing it to a party, i ac	1
I really wanted to like this dress, but it just didn't suit me. i have others in a similar style, and they are a bit tight in the bust but not too much for me. the print is adorable - very quirky, but subtle. in the end, it's the bright white that doesn't work for me. it made me look incredibly pale.	1
This dress is lovely fabric, generaly nicely tailored, but weirdly large around armholes, which gap. i'm sending it back. also this 'red' is more like a fuschia.  dress was generally a a bit too big on top, oddly both too long in the torso, and the shoulders cut too far in--they didn't cover bra straps--as well as unattractively large armholes. you can even see it on the model. i i'm a size 10 to 12, fairly busty but not extremely, and with a slightly short torso, which is party the problem (th	0
"This is a great sweater. it can be worn ""wrapped"" as on the model, or open like a cardigan. it is a lighter weight knit, perfect for how warm this winter has been. i love the deep purple color. normally between a small and medium and went with the medium in this sweater."	1
"I went to my local retailer store on saturday to pick up some new cute things that i had my eye on. after collecting the items i came in for i saw this romper! i tried it on and it was 'amazing""  comfortable , soft and so versatile!!! bonus!!! i left so tremendously happy!! it will be a win for  many years to come!!!!!!!!!!!"	1
I love this dress. it is very cute and comfortable and great for football games / everyday wear. it is a little long, which is great for me since i'm taller.	1
This is a lovely dress, with great fabrication. nice detail on the zipper placket. good material. however, it runs small in the waist, if you had a nymph waist this is for you! i couldn't get it zipped.	1
The tank top fits well. i usually boarded between a large and an xl and i got a large in this shirt which was perfect. it is kind of thin material so i wear a white tank under it. it's not too big in the armpits which is nice so my bra doesn't show. material is really soft and comfortable. it fits loose but not baggy.	1
Made for a straight figure - no curves. awkward bra situation as it has to be strapless because of the keyhole.	1
These are the perfect leggings. they're so soft, and they don't stretch and droop throughout a day of wearing them. i ordered the grey and moss, and they have different textures, which is fun.	1
It was cute. i didn't keep it because it wasn't soft and hung a bit different than pictured. i thought it would be softer material. it was itchy	0
Versatile and fun dress. color is better in person than picture. looks great with jeans jacket for chilly moments. doesn't wrinkle on long airplane trip and rolls up teeny-tiny for packing!	1
Just bought this jacket on sale and i love it! it's like a soft compfy sweatshirt , love the longer length. i feel like it runs pretty true to size. i usually buy an xs or small and the small fit fine. the sleeves are a tad long but not too bad, the model has them scrunched up but i find they are too snug to do that. i would highly recommend this jacket, just love the feel and look of it.	1
"This picture does not do this blouse justice. the material is velour where the flowers are and there's a bit of sparkle. i'm generally a pl in other stores and bought a m and was pleased. it's true to size. i'm 5'1"" and the regular length was perfect and not too long at all. i won't have to shorten it. the blouse will look great with skinny jeans and boots or the right long flowy skirt. it can easily be worn to a dressy occasion. it's gorgeous!!"	1
Beautiful, unique design. it's very flattering the way the fabric hangs. i usually wear a 10, but because the lining is much smaller than the dress (which many linings are... it's a pet peeve of mine), i sized up to a 12 and took in the shoulders a couple inches so the bodice area would sit correctly on my bust. otherwise in the 10 my stomach would feel squeezed even if it looked like it fit perfectly. that said, i'm very sensitive to that kind of thing. other reviewers have noted that the emb	1
"I really wanted to love this dress, but it was so short! i'm only 5'6"" so i don't consider myself really tall, but the dress only came a couple of inches lower than my butt! way too short for me. my husband asked if it was a shirt or dress haha. but i think this would look adorable on someone a few inches shorter. or someone younger who can pull of a short shirt :)"	1
These jeans are so soft! fit is great and i love he higher waist as well. i can tell i will be wearing the heck out of these.	1
"Loved the dress, but the white of the dress was neon white, way too bright and made it look terrible against my skin. i can imagine this looking good on someone with darker skin. but i""m my pale skin it looked bad. otherwise the fit was great, besides missing out on the petite sizes which are sold out."	1
This looks like the perfect easy sweater with the white shirt appeal to it, but sadly the fit of this number is really off. it looks more like a tent. it must have been clipped in the back or something. i cannot see any scenario in which this would look good...	0
It's rare for a dress to completely not work on me, but this dress completely did not work on me. i'm tall and have an hourglass figure. i got this dress in my usual size s. this dress somehow made me look ridiculously pear shaped. the empire type bust of the dress made both my bust (32c) and my waist look pretty much non-existent. it looked so bad on me i actually laughed. it's a shame though, because i had been eyeing this dress for a long time. and it is a beautiful dress, but i would not rec	0
Purchased in the blue. the color is a little darker than it shows. more of a slate blue. loved the fit. i am tall so it covered perfectly.	1
I had been looking for something like this to add to my summer wardrobe. fortunately for me i saw these in the retailer catalog and thought, how perfect, exactly what i've been searching for. they are a bit pricey, and crotch hangs a bit lower on me because i'm only 5'3, but it's not enough to make me send them back, i will have them altered if need be, they are to cute.  i'm a size 4 in pants and ordered the 29, i wanted some wiggle room, i didn't realize the denim has stretch, i will keep the	1
Deletta has done it again, designed a top that is unique, flattering, and comfortable. the blue is an intense peacock blue. the only draw back about this top (and with other deletta tops) is that they leave some of the fabric with raw unfinished edges. for this top it is located at the hole the twist creates. it's hidden but i worry about it fraying after a few washes. not sure why they couldn't continue the zigzagging at that opening. perhaps it wasn't cost effective to sew five more inches of	1
Ditto what the first reviewer said, unfortunately. i was so looking forward to receiving this dress but the one received is not the one in the photos. the graphics are fantastic - still love the boats- but the top is not the same and they've added a fabric belt to the finished dress. the fit was perfect except for gapping under the arms (similar, i suspect, to what the first reviewer reported). i was also surprised by the fabric. based on the photos i was expecting something light and semi trans	0
This dress has rich color, excellent quality fabric and wonderful style. you can wear it now for fall with boots and jean jacket or in the summer for a great sun dress.	1
This dress is very flattering. great unique dress.	1
When i spotted this online i just knew it was a 'must have'. holding horses brand usually runs big on me, but this is a more fitted top. i ordered the size 4 & 6 so i cld compare. well, the 4 is a little snug in the bust area & the bodice seam falls high across the mid-bust area. except for that the fit is good. being cotton i realize it will probably shrink some when washed so i don't think the 4 works for me. the size 6 is much looser overall & the fit is much better in the bust area. the armh	1
I ordered xs petite. the base of the neck was itchy... if you wear a turtle neck sweater inside, it should be fine. the other parts were very soft.	1
This top is such a great investment piece. looks classy and is comfortable all at the same time. it is pricey but you will not regret buying this. goes great with light trouser denim or i have the green pilcro khakis. it will he something you will keep in your closet for a long time.	1
Runs a bit small, but this top is super soft like all the cloth and stone tops. great for all seasons!!	1
"I wore this dress for this first time today, and it is a head-turner. sure to be a new favorite! i received several compliments while out running errands. the dress is flattering to my hourglass shape (i tied it in the back). it is not at all clingy; it flows nicely. the top of the dress is bra-friendly and not too low cut. i am 5'8"" and found the length to be just right for me; the medium skims the tops of my feet, and i wore the dress with flat sandals. unlike another reviewer, the dress i rec"	1
"Great top. i bought it for my daughter and it is well made and the fabric is very nice. she is 5'4"" and it reaches just the top of her jeans."	1
This dress is stunning. i have been stopped in the street by people asking where the dress is from. my only complaint is that it was very wrinkled when i bought it. initially i thought it was supposed to be that way, but after seeing the stock photos i realized it needed to be ironed. it took a long time to iron all of the wrinkles out, but it is totally worth it.	1
Thylo strikes again! this dress was magic the second i put it on - flowy, polka-dot magic! this baby can transform itself as you go from a casual day out to an dressy evening, with plenty of customizable options in between. to dress down, it looks great with a denim jacket, then take the jacket off and you are ready for some dressed up fun. you can pair it with tall boots or short, sandals, pumps, you name it. the ties at the neck look great undone, loosely tied, or done in a bow. leggings or ti	1
If you are self conscious about your arms and want a tee that has style then this is the one. soft fabric with a flutter sleeve makes this top so flattering. i purchased the turquoise and will purchase other colors. it's flowy comfortable and a must have!	1
Even though this is an online exclusive, i was able to try on a one off in the store. i have been looking for a cross front dress and the other option currently at retailer (the black and white striped top version) in a similar length) looked awkward. this dress looks great on but i needed the xs. i usually wear a 2. it was cute and i came online to see if the xs was available but it is sold out. the dress would be perfect if it had pockets!	1
This piece didn't make sense to me.  maybe it's bc i'm a yankee fan but it reminded me of a high end baseball jersey that was sheer.  i didn't think it was office appropriate but too dressy for casual wear.  it went back.	0
These pilcro jeans are so very cute. i usually wait for a sale to purchase the pilco jeans, but i didn't want to chance them not being available in my size. the pilco jeans seems to sell out fast. the cotton material is very soft but not sloppy. you will love the embroidery down the side of the leg. they do run a bit big. i purchased them in one size smaller for a slimmer fit. i would suggest one size up if you like them more baggy.	1
The design is beautiful but it was thick and too warm for a summer event i was planning on wearing it to. also, the seam below the chest was uncomfortable. needed to return	0
"I really wanted to like this dress. i am 5'3"" 125 lbs and this dress was about 4 inches too long. the hem created a puddle around my feet. i've bought other maxis from retailer without this problem. sadly it went back to the store."	0
This top is so darling, the different textures are so elegant that you really don't even need to accessorize. it has a very flattering cut and a must for any figure.	1
I am a big fan of trench coats and i love that this one is navy. i typically gravitate toward blues because it brings out my eyes and my wardrobe tends to fall in a blue-ish category. i love that the color of this coat will compliment other pieces of clothing in my closet wonderfully. i especially love the design of the trench with the wider, pleated bottom which allows for fluffier dresses but also creates an illusion that is slimming for anyone's figure. this is a fantastic, unique design for	1
This dress is very pretty and we'll made. it runs pretty big though and i would suggest going a size down.	1
Love this top, purchased it in the coral color now i'm definitely wanting it in the blue since it is such a great blouse for transitioning into fall. the weight of the top it good since i live in south texas so definitely needing lightweight long sleeves for our weather. i'm sure when the time comes adding a long cardigan or blazer over it as needed for the cooler weather it will look great. fit true to size.	1
Absolutely love this suit. the bottoms are very comfortable and covers everything id like it to. it does not ride up at all, which almost never happens with swim suits. i'm going to order this in a different color next season. i paired the bottoms with the peplum top and received many compliments.	1
Ok so this top is as cute in person as it is online. runs very small as theres no stretch or give in fabric. i normally wear 12 and i couldnt even halfway get this on lol. i may consider a 14-16 but the stores didnt have this yet to try on. the ladies at the counter were crushing on this top though! if you can find your fit this top is great for layering!	1
The print and front ruffle are beautiful. the sleeves are awful and poorly represented in the picture of the model. it's almost like the sleeves have a life of their own - so mismatched with this style of blouse. such a beautiful print but so disappointing in shape.	0
Pretty tank, embroidered flowers just as pictured. slightly see through so that a cami would be a must. for the price, should be more of a show stopper...unfortunately just average.	0
Really cute dress -- the lace-up detail is distinctive, and i think this dress will be versatile. great for hot weather, but i tried it on with retailer skinny pants, and that looked cool too. the included slip (not a lining) is soft and not clingy. i'm on the petite size and often find that relaxed-fit dresses like this make me look like i'm wearing a sack, but this one is not too billowy or shapeless. i tried the mango color on in the store, and really wanted to buy it, but the color just is not	1
I was really excited for this top to arrive and was really disappointed once i tried it on. i am sure this is a gorgeous top on someone with a straighter or more slender frame. it is good quality and looks fine on the hanger. i think the color in the picture online accurately shows the color. ladies with hips or a booty, beware...this looked horrible on me! it clung to my butt and didn't hang nice and straight like it does in this picture. i expected the fabric to have a little give to it but it	0
This top is beautiful. everything about it is beautiful. it has lovely detail on the back as well as the front. i chose a size 12 which seems to run true. it fit. however, regretfully i had to return the top. i came back here hoping i could find it in ivory or black... but there's only one color. the dusky rose is lovely, but i'm blonde and true pink is fine; this shade not so good, although as someone else here commented, it is a stunning shade of pink, very unusual -- like old dried roses. i l	1
I really wanted to love this top but the other reviewers are spot on when they say it is too short and boxy. so, fresh out of the package, the ruffle hit me right at the widest part of my hips and when i raised my arms the shirt exposed my midriff. not cute. i really liked the quality though so i washed it on delicate and then tugged gently to stretch the length out and hung to dry. now, it's still a wee boxy, of course, but significantly longer and much cuter on me. so, i'm keeping. even thinki	1
"I bought this dress in the orange and it is great for summer. even though i am normally a small/size 4 at 5'5"" & 118 lbs, i opted for the 6 because i am busty (34d). this was the right call. the dress is comfortable, flattering and i got lots of compliments. it's a keeper!"	1
"This is even nicer in person than it is online. i absolutely love it. i am 5' 5"" and 128 lbs. and ordered my usual size small. i probably could have worn an extra small, but don't feel like the small is too big. this could be my favorite purchase of the season."	1
I loved the blue brocade since it's a little unusual, paired with a top that brings an otherwise formal fabric into something you could wear out to dinner, plus a little pop of extra color from the ribbon! my biggest fear ordering online was that the top would look cheap - fortunately it doesn't. the top of the dress was fitted (i wore my usual size). what i didn't expect, though, is the skirt is really poofs out a lot below the ribbon, which runs just below the bust. the photo online shows a li	0
"This is a beautiful coat nicely constructed and very warm. it was just too bulky for me and i looked 10 lbs heavier in it. i am 5'7"" and 140 lbs. maybe it would be better suited to a more slender frame."	0
"This dress is gorgeous in person. it is so much softer than it appears the photo and the fabric moves well. what you can't see from the picture is that the bodice sort of overhangs the skirt by an inch or so which is really nice for accentuating a small waist and separates the top from the bottom in a cool way.  i am 5'6"" 135 lbs and curvy. 36-26-39 for reference. i ordered the 4 and it is loose although still flattering thanks to the forgiving cut. wish i had gotten a 2 but now they are sold"	1
This dress is very beautiful and looks great on, however had to downsize one size.	1
I am very happy with this suit! it is gorgeous and very well made. my only suggestion is to use your normal swimsuit size when ordering rather than their recommendations. i am a 4-6 in dress size but am curvy with a large bust. i went with a medium because i thought there was no way i would wear a small! the medium actually fits great in the waist and bottom, however is small in the top for me. i'm ordering a large to compare coverage.	1
I wanted to love these pants, but they were larger than i expected and the fabric is very heavy. almost like a thick sweater.	0
This romper is so flattering. i normally don't like how short rompers are, but this fits and flares at the perfect spots on me. not to mention that it's super comfortable. i wore it last weekend and got a ton of complements. very happy i bought it! i normally wear a medium, but the small fit me perfectly?i'd recommend sizing down.	1
I love the way this dress looks on me. it skims my figure to hide my flaws, the bright embroidery is eye catching, the layers flow when i walk, it's a great midi length and it doesn't make me look wider in profile.  i'm not having the see-through issue since the patterns are busy and my lingerie matches.  i purchased 10 petite and my measurements are 39-28-35.  my dilemma is three fold: the material is polyester & rayon, causing some uncomfortable heat to generate when sitting. then there's	1
Was so excited to get this dress because i thought it was cute and i love flowy and big dresses - however this looks huge. the material is not soft so it doesn't fall well. it just stays proofed out so from the back you look like a giant!!	0
The shape was not as nice on model, seemed like a lot of extra material.	0
"Just got this dress and am very pleased.  fell in love with the bright color in the store and then came home ordered it at a great sale price!!  color is as shown...beautiful lace trim at the bottom.....back longer than front as described and pockets!!  i am 5'2"" and length on a large comes to just below the knees..in front....i may wear leggings under it...dont like the slip as it is far too tight...will wear a tee or turtle under it..  quality heavier fabric. roomy... linen and cotton."	1
Really like this tee but i do wish it was made of another material. i like the design. simple with a nice macrame detail. the material is a very plain with much to be desired. ultimately kept the shirt but would have loved it more if it was made with something that felt better quality.	1
"Love this top. yes it is a swing top so you have to be prepared for the extra fabric. fits true to size thru the shoulders and chest. body of the top then flares for the ""swing"" effect. great top. plan on ordering it in the other colors."	1
Ooo la la! sooo chic! sooo retailer!!	1
This is such a pretty dress. i was worried the arm holes would be too big since it was hard to see them in the pictures, but they are perfect! there is a built in red slip underneath. it is so cute on and really flattering by itself or even with some white skinny crop jeans underneath!	1
I got this skirt earlier this week and wore it for the first time today. i love the color and the shape. everyone else loved it on me. it looked great with a buttondown. but, i will say that it's short. i'm usually a petite in bottoms, and i wore tights so i wouldn't flash anyone when i bent down. i can only imagine how it would be on a taller girl. it also fits at the natural waist instead of the hip. i'm usually a size 6 in bottoms, but i bought the size 4 because it sits higher up.	1
As in the other review, this dress runs small. i'm usually an 8 but it was tight and short. i would love to exchange for a 10 but it's out of stock. the beading and the colors on this dress are breathtaking...i was so disappointed it didn't fit! the background is more taupe/nude than cream which i actually really like.	1
This is going to be perfect for my daughter's graduation. she is in love with it and it looks amazing on her!	1
"It's not them it's me. so sad. ordered two sizes 25 r and 24 p. nothing about them worked for me. i loved the colors (blue and green). i loved"" the fabric (heavy washed soft cotton). i loved the style. ah but there is the rub. i am so small that the width of the legs just swallowed me up. whereas the 24s fit around the waist and the length, while longer than i'd have liked was doable, there was just so much fabric around my skinny legs i felt as though i was wearing huge balloons on each leg. (t"	1
Ordered my regular size s early this week and was thrilled to receive them yesterday. they fit just as expected and are quite comfortable. i would definitely recommend them as a nice alternative to pajamas or even as a slip.	1
"Love this poncho! purchased xs in gold/olive color and the length is good. i could have sized up for extra length but thought there was too much fabric in body. for reference-5'8"". slender. love the diagonal cable pattern and curved design. the sleeves are more comfortable for me pushed up a little but if left long works well and are about wrist length. the color is great for fall but could easily transition into winter.spring. the gray is a lighter gray and is nice, too, but size xs not availab"	1
I love these pants! they are comfortable and dressy enough for work! the wide leg is the perfect size and the higher waist is professional! these are also nice and long for wearing heels. i ordered a size 27 and they fit great. i normally wear a size 6 in us sizing.	1
"I love these shorts!!! they are thin lightweight and not see through. however the reviews are correct. i am usually a size 2 or 4 in shorts. i am 5'1"" 112 pounds and i had to size up to 6.. i was able to zip the shorts up but the fit wa a little tight. the 6 offered me the comfort of more room.. overall nice shorts.."	1
This t fits perfect and looks great with just about anything. my only concern is the fabric is super light. not enough to be see through, but just enough to make me question the quality. i like it and i have worn it a couple of times now with no issues though. the drape is nice and not super revealing; discreet enough for work. i ordered the white and if it holds up i will certainly order another color because it is very versatile.	1
In love with this. as soon as i received it in the mail i ordered another color. super soft and easy to wear. i imagine i will live in this top the rest of the summer. felt pricey, but worth it for as much wear as i will get out of it. i am 5'10, 160 and the large is a great fit. perfect fit on the shoulders and just a hair loose throughout the rest of the tank, which is what i wanted.	1
I love these jeans and want to keep them but they are so long! im 5'7 and they wrap all the way under my feet so i cant even have them altered because it would cut the flare out. its kind of crazy how long they are.	1
"I love this dress! i was apprehensive about it at first, because of the light material and boxy style. turns out the material is very flattering, and it hangs very well. the style isn't as boxy as it seems. it still flatters the figure without showing all your imperfections and it doesn't fit like a tent. i am 5'4"" and i ordered the petite. it's short enough to show off you legs, but not too short. for being less fitting, i like the balance of the short length, and it looks great with heeled boo"	1
This will be a cardigan i will wear across all seasons. if you want to layer a button down or another long sleeve shirt under it i would suggest sizing up one size. as soon as i put this on it felt like it molded to me. it's beautiful! and comfortable.	1
I loved the look of this sweater, but the workmanship was surprisingly poor. there were missed stitches, and loose threads throughout, and even a tag sewn to the outside. retailer was great about the return. i really wanted to keep it and was very disappointed.	0
This skirt is really adorable, but only if you're going to tuck in your tops. the pockets flare out at the top, so shirts don't lay correctly on them. instead the bottom of the shirt floofs out and looks really dumpy. tucked in though, super cute! the waist is really tiny and the fabric has no stretch to speak of. i usually take a 0/2 pant or 25/26 jean. i ordered the xsmall and could only get the top fastened by really sucking it in and struggling. i'll be exchanging for a small, hopefully t	1
Love this shirt- i got the white/yellow one and with a pair of dark jeans and booties i was ready for anything. i have an hourglass type figure, and sometimes with flowy shirts that is hidden. but this shirt somehow subtly emphasized that in an attractive way!	1
"The previous review by beardedlady said it best: ""yes, i do still feel like a little girl playing dress up in it but i don't care. this is a fun, creative dress to be worn on the days when you feel like having a julie andrews moment.""  in my own opinion, i don't think i can wear this without a topper covering the poufy shoulders so i'm happy that i own the dara moto jacket in plum to toughen up the look. i am 38-27-35/36c/135# and the bodice feels a little loose all over with the size 10 re"	1
Really interesting, beautiful colors. i found it to be short, even in the regular size (and i'm 5'1 with a short torso). wish the fit was slimmer, but i could see it working with jeans, or being stunning with a black ball skirt.	1
This is a perfect fit! i was worried that it would be too short and or boxy. i usually  wear an xs. i have a slightly longer waist though and often xs tops run short or they are overwhelming! this was perfect! it is roomy and long enough without swallowing my frame. it looks nice enough to dress up and wear out and about. great value at the sale price as well!! it is well made and doesn't just look like a run of the mill pullover.	1
"I had this in my cart for a week before i took the plunge, because i thought it would make the cutest boho statement piece that could go from beach to casual evening outings. i'm 5'9"", so i got the m/l to ensure length. maybe that was wrong? if the ""laid flat width"" was included maybe that would have been more helpful, but this thing was massive and looked like a potato sack. the side slits (of course hidden in the photos) came up to just over my natural waist, enhancing that effect. i loved the"	0
"I've been looking for some new, casual tops and ordered this one for the sky blue color. i'm a size 6 and the small fits great. i don't find the blowzy style overwhelming. i am small boned but i'm 5'8"", not a petite. i like it with leggings and skinny jeans ...a nice proportion. however, i can see how this cut may be too much on someone with a smaller frame. i really like it, however i see two drawbacks: the material is a bit thin for fall and it wrinkles very easily (not good for travel). this"	1
I bought this top for my sister's birthday so the review is based on her opinion. she loved it and told me the embroidery was beautiful. she said it was tts. she also stated that the blouse was so versatile and could be worn dressed up or down.	1
"Yikes. there is a whole lot of skirt here. i am 5""4, weigh around 120 lb, and usually wear anywhere between a four and six in retailer clothing, depending on the designer. this skirt balloons out from the waist. on the website it seems to flow more naturally from the waist. i think that the flowers are cute but the material is cheap looking. the skirt is very long- hitting way below mid-calf. there is also tons of material - creating a parachute effect. definitely returning."	0
"I really like this sweater a lot. it runs huge though. i have a m/l and i'm swimming in it (5'9"" sz 12-14). i like the length and the swingy-ness. there's enough coverage for me to feel comfortable layering it over a bra cami and leggings. the shoulder detail is what makes it. the only downside is that the threads on the reverse side of the embroidery are a little rough, but not enough to bother me. the knitted fabric is soft and cool feeling. i plan on wearing it into fall with ""real pants"" and"	1
I love this dress. the length is great and the dress just feels great. the material is raw silk (which i love) and the sizing does run a tad large, but with the make of the dress. i can lose weight and still wear the dress. well made and the buttons in back are super cute.	1
This coat is very soft and flattering in design. good quality and very comfortable. i usually wear a small which is what i got and it fits well. if anything, it is a little snug across the shoulders when i reach forward, so if you plan on wearing a heavier layer underneath, go up a size.	1
I saw this online and loved it, then when it was on sale i went into the store and tried it on and i couldn't resist. the only size that was left in stores was an xs petit and i didn't think that it would fit me because i am usually a regular s/m but it was super comfortable and very stylish. it wasn't too big or too small, it fit me just right without any awkwardness.	1
Nice jeans, just fyi they look more slimly fitted in the photo than they actually are when you get them. that's why i returned them. otherwise, fine.	1
I loved the look of these jeans-super cute-however they were way too tight! i ordered my usual size 31. they don't fit like a darker pair of serif jeans i own. back they go ! i'd be curious if anyone else found these to run smaller.	1
"What a beautiful dress! after reading all the other reviews i ordered a size small petite. way too big. the dress sagged down so the waist was at my hips. there was a good 4 inches that i could've taken in. in addition the arm holes showed my entire side of my bra. even if i sized down to an xsp my bra would be visible. such a pity because i loved the blue motif. no issues with the zipper as others have mentioned for reference i'm 5'2"" 107 lbs average proportions."	0
I tried the xs in store and waistband is very stretchy and the material is lightweight (feels delicate) and to the floor. fell in love with the watercolor print. this would be great as a quick cover up over a bikini. beware- if you plan on wearing this anywhere besides by the beach, make sure to rock your nude undies because the cream color is super see-thru, which is my least favorite part of this piece. i couldn't get to the petites sizes before they all sold out, so i'm crossing my fingers th	1
These trousers are wonderful. the fabric is comfortable and does have a little give to it.	1
I wanted a casual, denim colored skirt for warmer weather without the denim weight  and this skirt fit my needs perfectly.  i'm 5'4, 117lbs and the xs fits me true to size, hitting about 1 1/2 inches above the knee. it's a more modest length for daytime but it definitely needs a slip underneath. the raw edge is subtle (no hanging threads) and unique. i can't speak to the lack of colorfastness but i washed it separately and will be mindful of the possibility .	1
"This skirt is absolutely beautiful and in my opinion, totally worth the price. it's very, very well made and fits perfectly. i usually wear a size 4 but with skirts that are supposed to sit right at my waist, i size down to 2 so they fit properly. i did that with this one and i have to wiggle a bit to get it past my hips but once on it fits like a glove. i'm 5'11"" and the skirt comes to mid-calf on me which is exactly what i was looking for. love love love this skirt, i totally recommend it."	1
I recently bought this is a medium black and it is a perfect fit.  it's a beautiful top and the peplum portion is perfect and long enough for someone with a lon torso.  for reference, i'm 6ft 175lbs and usually wear a 10/12 or medium/large top.  i went with the medium based on other reviews. i  i was lucky to find this on sale.	1
Scratchy, wide cut = not flattering, i tried to make this work because i wanted a different, unique cardigan. but.... the color is not for me either.., it's yellow/ivory. bummer! so cute on the model! the snaps are my very favorite part!	1
Listen to all the reviews, size down! i got the dress in my usual size large thinking it would fit well size i have large hips and a booty, i was wrong!!! i could camp out in the large! it was super large!!! got the medium and its fit amazingly! its a tad bit tight in the chest(barely tight) but im a 38dd and this is not an unusual thing for. i just need to wear a thinner bra and it will be perfect! cant wait to wear it! loving the velvet trend this fall! thinking about getting the blue too!	1
"I purchased this in both the black and the turquoise and wish they made more colors! this top is perfect for our florida 90 degree weather! i am usually a medium in tops (size 6-8), broad shoulders, size 36c and i purchased this in a 6p and a 6 (as they were out of petite in turquoise). i do prefer the 6p as i am 5'2"". i would say this runs generous as there is ample room to move. i wear mine with a nude bra on the turquoise top and the bra straps show a bit, but they are almost covered by the s"	1
When i saw the dress i loved everything about it except the arms made me a little nervous. i ordered it when it went on sale and it turns it the arms are worse then i thought they would be. they are like my grandmother crochet it and accidentally attached my child's dress arms on my dress.	0
The details on this dress were pretty, but it was super poofy and i felt like it made me look bigger than i am. maybe if you have a straight body and want to create curves this would work for that, but not great on an hourglass/pear shaped figure. fits tts.	1
Super cute poncho to add to my wardrobe.  love the grey color and the material is super soft.  glad i snagged this up for less than $30!	1
This sweater looks just as pictured on the model. its very warm though even with cropped sleeves. i ordered a large and it was true to size but roomy. i liked this top very much but is thicker than seems. outer grey material isn't very pleasant & itchy, however the bottom portion is an underneath gown and attached to sleeves inside so its very soft on touch.	1
I got the honey colored and love the color. they are very comfy and soft. i look forward to wearing them all summer	1
I was excited to see this top on sale as i had been watching it for a few weeks. unfortunately, i was very disappointed when i received it. it is, as a previous person said, very much like a pajama top. it is very loose and boxy, and in my opinion, did not flatter my shape at all. sadly, i will be returning it. i would not recommend this top to a person who is athletic, or straight and slender, as you suggest.	0
These pants are awesome! very light weight and will be great for spring/summer. now if only the sunshine will get here and melt away all of this snow! i also purchased the top pictured on the model, it is super cute with this outfit and can work with so many different looks. check it out! they run big, i would definitely consider sizing down or ordering two sizes to try on.	1
This is a really pretty print on a decent top. the only reason i returned is because it didn't look good with my skin tone and the fabric is thin. i'd planned to use it as a later under cardigans.	1
Lovely summer top, comfortable and cool for hot summer days. beautiful fabric, fits tts. highly recommend.	1
This screams the old school classic retailer that we all love. it was one of my rare full price purchases because it's just perfection! i'm 5'4, 112lbs and normally and xs. however, when i tried on an xs is store i felt that it sort of swallowed me up. i went ahead and ordered an xs petite even though i rarely go with petites, but it fits perfectly. it doesn't leave room for layering, but i live in socal, so i don't need to layer often.	1
I really like this dress but after looking at the photo, it doesn't look like this, well at least on me. granted, i am 36dd so that might be part of the reason, but this dress is definitely trapeze style. i love the look but am cringing at the thought that someone is going to think i am pregnant. because of this, a belt is a must. plus it is the only way to achieve the look in the photos because it is a lot fuller in real life.  another nice touch to this dress is that versatility with the ru	1
I am keeping these because the style is just cute as a button! ;) the button details on the ankle are so adorable. i would normally wear a size small but like the other reviews said they run small - i purchased the ml and they fit great. i wore them all day to work and they are slightly itchy....and during the day they would fall down and i would have to keep pulling them up. reminded me of when i was a little girl and my mom made me wear tights. however....they are too cute to not have. i will	1
This is my new favorite dress! my only complaint is the slip is too small and the dress cannot be worn without it. i can't order a size up as the dress would then be huge. not sure what the solution is but the dress itself is stunning.	1
Love this piece! i hope to see more cute, fun dresses like this from retailer. the greatest feature is it is super comfortable! it could be worn to a great number of events, dressed up or down for any occasion.	1
Size 0 ordered .they fit beautifully for the first 2 hours but slowly stretched out and lost their shape sadly.	1
This is comfy and casual and fun to wear.  moss ombrã© is darker and less ombrã© than pictured, so i wish i had gotten the other color way instead.  i can see myself wearing this for running errands, grabbing take-out and other important things like hanging out on my couch.  definitely size down or this will look too wide & boxy.	1
This is a very well made top. i love everything about this top! bought it in both colors. i think it's fancy enough to wear out at night or in the daytime with shorts and flip flops. i got it on sale but would have totally paid regular price for it!	1
Woke up this morning to an email from retailer showcasing this gorgeous jacket. i knew i had to have it. trying it on in the store, it did not disappoint! hei hei is a really wonderful brand, and me being a more plus sized gal, their sizing is always wonderful. i normally do an xl in most retailer jackets and tops,..but i was able to do a l well. the arms have plenty of room and the body of the jacket has a room as well (like your typical bomber would). the fabric is soft and the blush color	1
I loved the color of this shirt but it does run big. i even sized down and it was still large on me and the ruffles flare out a bit which was not flattering one me. it looks pretty on the hangar.	0
I bought this shirt in 3 colors. soft, comfortable fabric, as other reviewers have mentioned, and nice detailed sleeve. i am gravely disappointed in the fabric quality since after wearing this one time with a necklace (as shown in the picture) it developed tiny pulls. i should mention that it was a very plain necklace, nothing sharp, pointy etc. i will most likely return all 3 shirts.	0
These are very well constructed, medium weight, besutiful leggings.	1
Wanted to love this colorful romper. the fabric was suuuuper thin and very cheap feeling and looking. no way would i wear this.	0
"I just got this in the green and i'd say the color is deeper/darker than shown. more of a turquoise-green, or muted teal color. it's the densest, thickest cashmere (it's 100% cashmere) i've felt in a while and it's so soft. but, it just doesn't look good on me. i'm 5'3"" and about 105 lbs, and usually wear xspetite. i got this in the xs regular hoping it would be long enough for leggings. and i don't think it is in the back. plus it's just too bell shaped and i'm slightly pear-shaped already. it"	1
This is a nice flowy dress that i plan to wear in the fall with long boots. i love how light it feels.	1
This is so flowing and perfect to hide any flaws.i adore it!	1
Love this sweater/jacket. fit is good and the colors are just right, not to bright and not boring. the shawl color takes a wee bit of adjusting but is worth the extra minute or so. also has a hood built into shawl that when not in use can not be seen, very cool. have worn it a couple of times and always get compliments.	1
"I'm a tunic lover so i'll usually take a chance on them. i""m 5'4'' and usu a size 8 or medium. i ordered a small instead of a usual medium since other reviewers said it runs small. this hits about mid thigh which is a good tunic length but the overall fit is oversized. it's more like a swimsuit cover up rather than a nice blouse. that's really the best way to sum it up. oversized swimsuit cover-up like top. i'm going to exchange it for an xs but i think even that's too large."	0
I can tell already that this sweater is going to be in heavy rotation in my closet. it's a bit oversized and cozy, but the ribbon tie makes it neat and not sloppy. great with skinny jeans, flares or leggings. super cute with a cami underneath.	1
"I see me wearing this dress with more of an edgey look - not going for romantic. smoky eye, skinny dark jeans under it and pumps. swings further from body than i thought. i'm 5'7"", wear a 34b and am typically a size 2. that's the size i bought. fits well and while pretty, it's made with heft ... not overly delicate - can't see this snagging. it's more of a cotton lace which is why it looks cool with skinny jeans. detail at the neck gives it more interest."	1
I am curvy/petite. this fits great, is true to size, is super comfortable and lined with cotton. very pretty and well made.	1
The only reason i gave this top a 4 star, is that it didn't have enough room around the bust area. i'm a d cup, and the front didn't button properly. but for the price i paid (40% off sale price), i have no coplaints. i would recommend.	1
I love these jeans, but they do stretch out! i was surprised at how loose they were right after washing/air drying the first time.	1
"So let me start by saying i love non-skinny cut jeans. i'm a curvy athletic type with thick legs, so when a jeans comes around with a ""generous"" fit, i'm thrilled! these jeans are generously cut through the hips and waist, giving it a boyfriend type of cut. the denim is soft, like your old favorite pair of jeans that have been washed 1000 times. i did size down one size and probably could have gone down one more size, but i still want a bit of a looser cut. pilcro denim always has stretch in the"	1
These sleep pants are very pretty, soft and comfortable. unfortunately, after washing them once i noticed some small holes in the fabric which is very disappointing considering the price. i don't mind paying a little more for clothing if i feel like the quality is there but in this case i'm not so sure. i guess if you don't really sleep in them or wash them then they would probably be ok but then what's the point of buying them?	1
"I have been eyeing these jeans for a while but was hesitant because of the price and also because i'm short waisted so don't normally like high rise pants. i finally pulled the plug when i had a 15% off code (still expensive imo). i am so glad i finally bought them - they are well worth the price! i am 5'6"" with longer legs and i agree with the other reviewers that these run a little longer than one might anticipate. they hit about 2 inches above my ankle bone, which suits me just fine. they are"	1
"First problem-i would not have ordered this at all had the description been correct. the fabric description is cotton which the dress is most certainly not. secondly, it has a really funky, cheap, unfinished, raw-hemmed slip which is simply not fitting for the dress. the keyhole in the front is super long-again, does not seem to fit the dress. i am not happy with this piece at all but it did fit tts. length is just above knee. i am 5'5"" 142 lbs 34d and the six was a good fit. sending this home t"	0
It's true to size but as an fyi for fellow pilcro high rise wearers, don't size down like you might with them. i had my regular and my high rise pilcro sizes and my regular size fit in these. the down side for these is they are clingy and a bit prone to a camel toe effect until they stretch out during the day	1
This would be perfect if only it were lined!!!! i have a high waist and hourglass shape so jumpers are very hard to find that fit my body type. this is a perfect fit for my body shape and when on, it looks like a lovely dress. however, it is not lined and the material is very light and ivory so you see everything. you can't wear a slip so that leaves the option of some sort of bodysuit if you don't want to show the world what you have. i am very tired of all of the light colored clothing not bei	0
"Tried this on in the store in a small (i'm a size 6 in most retailer dresses) and it was enormous. i'm short (5'2"") so i knew i'd need a petite size. ordered a petite small and the length is better - still a lot of fabric, but i think a petite xs would be too small if you are curvier up top (i'm a full 34d and the petite small is just slightly tight in the bust). definitely size down in this or you'll be swimming in it!"	1
I really did not need another coat at all, but i couldn't resist. got it in green - it's dark and woodsy,something robin hood and his merry men could wear in the forest to look and feel their most stylish. the structure is just right - this coat is soft, cozy and fluid, but also tailored enough to wear in a business casual environment... equally well-suited to wear on winter eve dog walks, to a football game, or at the coffee shop for a latte at an outside table. works with most of my wardrobe -	1
This blouse was exactly what i was looking for. perfect for those last balmy days of summer. fabric a bit sheer, but it flows beautifully and the pleating details and higher neckline make this top truly stunning. it is very flowy, so if you're looking for something more fitted, this might not be for you.	1
"This is quite possibly the greatest jacket of all time. i ordered it with the ""layered luna dress"" in grey, and i am now giddy with excitement to wear the combo! very chic. i am confident this will be a staple in the years to come. for reference, i ordered my normal size xs (5'5, 115 lbs, muscular) and did not find it to be too tight in the arms (and i have fairly broad shoulders). i did not try it on with long sleeves, but i still think there would be adequate room."	1
"This may be the ugliest dress with the worst fit i have ever tried. the blue stripes are brighter than they appear in the photo, absolutely garish. the top is baggy with awful beads on the back ties, it just looks cheap. the skirt is an antebellum nightmare.   i did not even want to try it on, it's that bad. i considered adding a photo, but was too horrified. for reference, i'm 5'10"", approximately the height/ size of the model, but it was shorter than the photo depictes. i wanted to like it,"	0
"This basketweave bikini top in fractals red by mara hoffman is my favorite right now. soft, fully lined, and reversible to pale pink as are the matching basketweave bikini bottoms. the pattern looks like a vibrant watercolor painting with some fuzzy edges.  . i got the size 's' according to the size guide on the mara hoffman site. i'm 5'2"" currently 33-25-37ish without a bra on (bra size 30d, 32c, even a 28dd if i can find it). the front coverage is perfect. it also fits around the back, but i"	1
I love love love this cardigan!! i ordered it in plum, regular small as they were out of petite small ( my preferred size). i was very impressed with the quality of the cardigan. the details like the sheer fabric around the neckline are very delicate and beautiful. the waist line sits exactly where it should. i was worried it would sit too low as i am short and did not get this in petite sizing. so maybe i should say this cardigan runs small. i think i have found the perfect cardigan. it goes wi	1
I have gotten so many compliments on this blouse! material is very comfortable and the fit is great!	1
Close but no cigar...  the design and color were cute.  the sweater itself was too warm for me, and itchy.  the top fit snugly in the chest and shoulders but it came out a little strangely at the bottom, it almost had strange fold in the front.  look closely at some of the photos and you'll see what i mean.  sadly it went back.	0
Great basic tee with just the right amount of extra detail. the length is perfect--not too long, not too short. fit is relaxed and comfortable without looking sloppy. i'm coming back for more colors!	1
This is a lovely skirt that fits well, but it is much more of a yellowy cream color than white. also, it felt very static-y.	0
This top is lovely and so perfect for this time of year when you want to look fall-ish but when it's still too hot to wear long sleeves. but i'm pretty sure it's navy, not black. very dark navy, yes. still, not black. compared to every other black top in my closet it looks navy. so that was a little disappointing. but i'm keeping it because i'm a sucker for a flowy top, and i can wear it right now.	1
I ordered this skirt because it looked cute and versatile. when it arrived the pleat in front (shown in the center) was far to the right so the overall look was crooked. not sure if it was a quality control issue or if that's the true design but it will have to go back. too bad because i had high hopes!	0
Great top, lately i've been sizing down from my usual xs to xxs with pure & good tops, but in this one the xs was best. i bought this in 3 colors and they're my go to tanks for summer. the mint is a bit sheer, but not bad. i did not get try the yellow or white one.	1
"This dress is wonderful. wide enough straps for a bra to be concealed, lovely pattern that draws the eye down instead of across, and a waistband that hits at the narrowest part of your midsection, making it look super-tiny. the design is simple but very clever--it's feminine, flattering, and slimming. my only quibble is that it's quite long (and i'm almost 5'7"" in my stocking feet)...i will have to wear heels or have it hemmed. highly recommend."	1
"This could seriously fit a large and it's an xs. so frustrating!! this is the fourth retailer dress that is ordered that is just enormous. i get the whole ""loose fit"" style, but seriously??? you've taken it to a whole new level, retailer!!! another trip to the store to return another item. a complete waste of my time. ugh."	0
I was really excited for this dress to come and hoped it would work well for a couple of holiday parties that i will be going to this season. i wasn't sure what i thought when trying it on, but i am thinking it will go back since i still am not super excited about it. for me the waistline was a bit high, and it had a bit of a frumpy feel. i love the floral pattern but overall it just wasn't amazing.	1
I love this top!!! i just had a baby and it is difficult to balance classy with comfortable with out looking sloppy. this top is perfect. it may run a tiny bit big but for the most part it is true to size. great for busty girls (36dd).	1
I did size up on this one. it came in and it was too snug for a loose shirt. i sized up and i love it now. i went to the store and bought it in white and black. i sized up in the white but not the black. you may want to try them on before purchasing them. i want more.	1
Love this sweater!  lightweight, comfy and does run large.   i usually wear a size 12 or l/xl in sweaters cause i don&#39;t like them to fit tight.  i read reviews and ordered a medium and it&#39;s perfect!  can&#39;t go wrong!  i ordered the red, but am now thinking of ordering the grey one!	1
Lovely dress. i did send it back only because the length was below my knee and i prefer slightly above the knee.	1
I just received the acacia swing tank and when i pulled it out, i felt like it was christmas day all over. it hangs nicely and felt luxurious on my skin. even my husband was dazzled. the detailing of the flowers is delicate and feminine. the cutaway gives you a sexy, casual chic appearance that you can dress up or down. i can't wait to unveil this new piece at work.	1
"These are very flattering thick leggings that would keep you warm in the fall and winter, but when i pulled them up i got a big hole in the seam at the waistband at my first trip to the bathroom! obviously you might expect a rip if they were too tight, but these fit perfectly (even on the looser side) and ripped effortlessly. pretty embarrassing given the price! bringing these back!  for reference ( if you decide to try your luck), i am 5'7"", 128# and my normal size s was perfect."	0
Bought this is black and white... love them but washed the white by hand and it shrunk...	1
I love this sweater. definite classic. i get lots of compliments on it.	1
Absolutely love this blouse but if your a woman cursed with larger arms for your body size than this is not for you. i couldn't get the lace part of the upper arms past my elbows. oh well, it's going back!	0
I wear size 8 , ordered a medium, fits great. nice quality, like that you can wear open or buttoned at the shoulder.	1
It's soft and feels nice on skin. true to size and fits just fine. more form fitting than model picture.	1
This top is gorgeous in both detail in color. it fit great and true to size, but then i hand washed it as instructed on the label and it shrank substantially to the point that it's now too short and needs to be returned.	0
Ladies don't let this beauty get away. never paid much attention to it on-line but went into local retailer today and it was returned by someone. i couldn't get it on fast enough. it is gorgeous. runs tts. i took the small, for reference i am 36c top and petite. this will work on any body type. you won't be sorry. well worth the money for the style and fabric.	1
This dress fits so perfectly.  just the right amount of skin, not too bare, not too short, not too long.  can't wait to wear it.  great quality.	1
The shirt fits true to size. the length of the top is great: not too short (won't show your midrift when you raise your arms) not too long (this is a shirt not a dress). this is a great top for a casual day in jeans or a flirty day with skirt to dress it up.	1
This coat is wonderful! i am usually an xs-s in retailer and i got the xs. it is supposed to be a bit large. goes with everything and great quality.	1
I really loved the uniqueness of this dress, and i was hoping to be able to wear it to work, but it was just a little too fitted for the office!	1
"I bought this tunic in black and am seriously considering buying it in more colors. it is so comfortable and very flattering. i am 5'11"", so many tunics are more like shirts on me, but this one is the perfect length to wear with leggings or pants. the v neck is a nice, feminine touch and i love the change in material around the edges."	1
Embroidered tulips look like they were plucked when comparing the dresses in the product photos. took a chance any way, came out disappointed because i couldn't zip up the bodice. i hate side zips and when you pair a cheap zipper with delicate material, recipe for disaster! i am top and back heavy so though i lost weight and went down a cup size, my back is too wide for the 12p. for reference i'm 135# 36d 38/28/35.	0
This is way cuter in person than on model. it is a super soft and fluffy sweater. the colors are so pretty and feminine. i received it as a christmas gift and have already worn it twice. it's perfect with skinny jeans and ugg boots. i vary between xs and small in retailer sweaters. this is a bit boxy so i sized down with the xs and it fits perfect!	1
Perfect dress for hot, humid, sticky weather.	1
Everything about this blouse is perfect - the color, the drape, the detail. so flattering and easy to wear. i just love it!	1
I like this robe a lot. the tassel detailing on the ties is beautiful. i like the soft interior-but wish it went all the way down the arms. the cozy part of the robe is only in the center section and hood-the arms can be a bit chilly while the rest of you is warm and cozy. i do not think the robe is necessarily flattering, in that it does not do me favors in the way of slimming, it is more of a cozy-around-the-house robe rather than one to hide lingerie underneath.	1
"I have about 3 or 4 akemi & kin tops. i usually take a small. i think this one runs a bit bigger. the armholes are too deep and there is just too much fabric for me. (5'6"" 125lbs) i am going to try to size down because i really like everything else about the top. orange is not my color but this has enough white to compensate. the pattern, button detail and fabric are all very nice."	1
I ordered this dress online in order to get a petite size and am very disappointed. as other reviewers have mentioned, the fabric overlay is very different in person than it appears in the online pictures. the dress is much more casual and looks cheaply made in person.  as for sizing, i ordered the 2p based on other reviewers' comments about it running small. the 2p fit me fine, although it was very fitted in the chest and i am very small chested #32b#. i can definitely see that being an issue	0
I ordered the blue in size 16. it ran at least two, if not three, sizes too small compared to my other retailer 14 & 16 blouses. it was too small through the body, other than the peplum. the arms were tight too. the waistline and length matched the online photos. it's widening. the material they chose was also scratchy and rough, especially around the neckline. i returned mine after trying it on and seeing there was no way to make this work. the blue color was gorgeous though. the patterned lace w	0
The other reviewers are right, this runs huge. why have a number of cute tops been running so large lately?! i'm 5'1 and 100 lbs and was drowning in the xxs petite. it also almost reached my knees. i thought it'd be a cute little tunic to wear in the fall but it just looks ridiculous because of how large it is and how there's no taper or shape. maybe even order 2 sizes down. the quality is pretty good if you can make the sizing work for you.	1
I love the way this loosley falls and is so light you barely feel it on you. it is very sheer to you need to wear another tank underneath.	1
I bought this coat shortly after christmas and am in love. it is meant to fit oversize but runs true to your natural sizing. i am a m/l in most retailer clothing and that is what i bought. it is great for layering for a dressed up look with a skirt or dress for work and also dressed down with jeans a t-shirt. and, although the arms are 3/4 length it is super warm! so happy i purchased!	1
Love this top! i have it in the green and i am tempted to go and buy it in the other colors! it is a simple, but cute top that is easy and comfortable to wear. a little dressier than a plain tee.	1
Super cozy! now that the colder weather is coming i will likely be wearing these every night relaxing at home!!	1
This is very cute in person. i love the colors, a tiny bit brighter in person. it is very feminine, with the ruffles, but with an edge. not too foo-foo. i tried no the regular size and it was a little short even on me, i would have to wear with higher rise pants, or show some belly... no petite on this one. the size 0 fit me at 115 lbs and 30dd chest. the material is light and airy, so great for warmer days. love it but in my wish list, didn't get it yet,...though the day it showed up at my loca	1
Love everything about this dress...cut, color, material and price!	1
When i received this dress in the mail, i was thrilled. i loved the color and the style, although a bit too much material but comfortable. when i went to show my husband the dress, his first comment was very sexy. i can see your underwear and your skin!!! i don't understand why no one mentioned this in any of the comments on this dress. when i went into the light i saw that the dress was see through and i sadly had to return it.	0
Beautiful victorian look blouse. runs large and overly blousy on me.	0
This top was a big disappointment. i ordered two of the grey motif with the print of the forest animals in size 16. neither of them fit well, but one was cut much smaller than the other. i've had this problem with all of the numerically-sized buttondown style of maeve tops. i don't understand why in size 14 & 16, this keeps happening. that's why i purchase two of each. usually one fits and the other doesn't. this time, unfortunately, neither worked. they both were too tight in the arms/shoulders	0
I purchased this dress yesterday and it's cute and fits great, but the embroidery across the back ripped as soon as i moved my arms. it's really delicate and strains anytime you lift your arms overhead or forward. i'm keeping it anyway because the supersoft pretty slip that come with it is worth the sale price.	0
Ordered my regular size large and the fit was a snug around my hips when snapped. i didn't plan on wearing it that way so that wasn't a deal breaker for me. but because i have a larger bust i felt the padding added pounds and lots of width to my frame. i also had the same issues with coloring as other reviewers. and lastly, the collar is really high and it just bugged me. so this one went back.	1
"I bought the ""here comes the sun"" version of this shirt. i had to have it. i'm a cervical cancer survivor who is still dealing with some health issues. i recently attended a cancer survivor event where a women talked about her life with cancer. she said that you no longer counts the years of her life, instead she counts her sunny days. i was inspired to do the same. so, i love this shirt. i got it on sale, but it still could've been cheaper."	1
Just received this in the mail, and i love it! the fit is wide and flowy, but i wouldn't say it runs large... i don't think i could have sized down in the shoulders. perfect easy, breezy fall top. cannot wait to wear it!	1
As soon as i saw this dress online, i knew i wanted it!  i was immediately drawn to the belled sleeves and lace embellishment along the neck/shoulders.  i ordered online, and was so happy with the fit and quality of the dress.  i am 5'5 and it hits just an inch above my knee.  it's the perfect little black dress for a fun date night or an event!	1
They are a perfect thickness. fits comfortably like leggings but look like a nice pair of office/ outside pant. got them in the grey, am thrilled w the texture. i typically wear a large in pants and they are tts. not see through either. would definitely recommend them.	1
This top is just adorable! so comfy and cute. i love the cut and how it goes a little longer in the back. i will be wearing this a lot!	1
This sweater is a dream come true for me. when i first spotted it during the 40% off sale, i didn't place my order in time to receive one. but then it came back a few weeks later, and i snatched one up! needless to say, the disappointment and wait was well worth it. the material is incredibly soft, the fit is just about right (i'm a size xs at retailer, without fail, and this was probably the snuggest fit out of all the tops i have). a few other reviews says that it runs big because of all the e	1
I love this sweater coat;! it's so nice and fits well. would look great with jeans or a skirt. the collar is adorable! have already worn it and received compliments! i love retailer :)!!	1
I liked the product shots of this cardigan, but when i opened it up out of the package i was kind of ...unimpressed... the green wasn't quite the color i was expecting, the fabric was rougher, the lace was scratchy, the fit was boxy, and the sleeves are very dolman... none of which translated through the pictures online... i still think it's cute, but it has a much more casual look to it than i was expecting. i might reconsider if it hits sale, but for now it goes back...	0
This is a great throw in your weekend bag summer dress. it runs a bit large, especially on the top, but i'll make it work. back is a bit low, so a cardigan would be required for office wear.	1
"I can't think of many things more comfortable than cloth & stone's fabric, so when i saw this jumpsuit i had to try it. it is a nice mid-weight perfect for fall weather or a mild winter like we are currently having in the northeast! looks very cute with a duster cardigan over it. fits true to size (meant to fit a little loosely). length is great everywhere on my 5'7"" frame. feels like wearing pajamas, with the benefit of looking put-together!"	1
"Saw this dress in the blue motif and thought it would be perfect for a summer outdoor wedding. i'm 5'4"" 125 lbs and ordered a size 2. it fit true to size in the shoulders, bust and length, but did not fit as pictured on the site; it looks in the pictures like there is some shape to the waistline without being too fitted, which i like. on me there was absolutely no shape. it just billowed and looked really maternity. 15 bucks for alterations to take in the sides and now it's my favorite darn thin"	1
This jumpsuit runs large so i sized down perfectly one full size down. i have a size b chest and was very comfortable with no bra, as the built in cups gave me the perfect coverage. it looked like a dress standing, but had such a flattering and fun shape when you move. everyone loved it!	0
This suit is so adorable! i love the retro style and the two patterns and i really wish it worked for me. the suit is comfy, seems well made and fit nicely. but, although it fit technically, i don't like the way it cuts me off at the thigh. it's not flattering for me at all.  the suit is kind of a neoprene material, so it's thicker than a normal bathing suit, so i think even though it isn't lined, it might not be see-through, but i didn't get it wet to test it out. in terms of fit, i think it	1
"I loved this dress as soon as i tried it on, but... it bunched up weird in the front around my hips. i ordered a second size 4, hoping that it would fit better. but same thing. if i tried to go to a size 6 it would be too big every where else. fyi - i'm 5'8"" 129lbs and i'm a runner. it's not like i have a huge backside or anything. my guess is sizing is off. i've tried another of his dresses and it fit perfectly."	0
I love this sweater. it is so soft and the pink is such a sweet shade. it is large and falls of the shoulder, but that's how it is designed to fit. it is my new favorite sweater!	1
"I love this dress as far as the fit goes. it makes my curvy figure loook even better with how it's cut. that being said the different patterns over each boob made the dress look crazy. it makes you look quite lopsided in the chest. wasn't just me, but my store people also agreed. had the pattern on the chest been the same it would be great, but even though my boobs are of ""mostly"" equal size, they looked too crazy. it's quite noticeable on. so sad:("	0
"I've had my eye on this poncho for weeks and finally scored the olive green one over thanksgiving/black friday special. i would say the color is more mustard yellow, which will go well with a variety of jewel-tone tops, etc. the poncho is a nice weight, but not too heavy. i am 4""11 with short arms, but i went ahead and bought the regular xs instead of the petite sizes and the length is perfect. i am seriously considering getting the cranberry one as well. a classic buy for winter which i'm sure"	1
I thought these pants had a great fit and the color is fabulous, i would have preferred a 30 inch inseam, but 31 is by far better than 34, that many designer jeans at department stores run.	1
This is one of those just throw on and go dresses that i love. it is breezy and easy, comfortable, but also polished and lovely with some really nice design features and a beautiful mixed print. you can wear it with some cute flip-flops, or polish it up with some cute boots.	1
I got lots of compliments on this dress as expected. the arm holes are a little large, meaning low. but other than that i love it.	1
I love to layer and this is a great layering piece. it is wonderful for cool crisp mornings . this cardigan looks great with skinny jeans and a cute tee. the model in the photo shows a super way to look great for a casual day. so soft and comfortable, i did not want to take it off on the cloudy day it was worn. very happy with this purchase and delighted i was able to get it on sale.	1
Very comfortable, well made, great with leggings or skinny jeans.	1
"I love the style of this jumpsuit. it is so much more interesting than a long dress. i am 5' 7"" and need a few inches hemmed which will cut off some of the pretty embroidery at the bottom. my biggest regret with this is that it is not made from better fabric. it is a little stiff and scratchy. if it were more silky it would be a dream. but i am happy to have this in my closet. i purchased this in the berry red."	1
It's too hot here in ca to wear this yet but i can't wait for cooler weather. i tried it on with skinny jeans and it's darling. love how it's much shorter in front with the side splits and long back to cover the bum. perfect for leggings. nice slim, but not tight fit.	1
"I tried this top in the store and i really like it. i am 5'2"", 34b with wide shoulder, tried on my usual size s in both colors and they both fit fine. however, i found that the ivory one fits a little bit loser compared to the blue one (by the way, the blue looked more like dark grey in person). the length of the ivory one seems to be a little bit longer than the blue one as well. since it is a drapery top, i like it to be roomy, so i purchased the loser/longer ivory one. it looks great with a j"	1
I love this dress now that it is on sale; sized down to sm petite, added a simple full slip. endless compliments and inquiries on where to buy it!	1
Buttons were broken off when i opened the package, stretchy at waist, not good quality for the price.	0
I saw this online and immediately purchased the top in gray. it's so easy and casual but the shoulder detailing give it something different and unique for a regular gray shirt. the fit is loose and comfortable but not overly big, just right. i can't wait to pair it with my new white jeans for summer!	1
I tried these on as a return at my store and sadly, they fit great everywhere ecept at the waist. i had almost 2 inches gaping at the waist... my usual size. the rest of the pant was absolutely awesome though. for reference, i tried n a 25 and am 115 lbs and short... bummer htey don't come in petite or 24...	1
Very pretty. love the design both front and back	1
I bought the black version of this dress. looks exactly like the picture and is true to size.	1
I love this dress . perfect fit and very good quality.	1
These make your rear look ah-maz-ing!!! i mean, seriously good. every time i wear these, my husband cannot keep his hands off. usually, i'm 27/28, in these i took a 29. perfection. i also got them in the black and blue washes. i may not be wearing any of my other jeans at this point. so good. awesome price point too.	1
"I love this top! the colors are beautiful & look incredible with jeans as well as so many of the different color pilcro pants in my closet. it's the perfect between-season item. since i don't like garments that have a ""boxy"" fit, i was concerned that this top wouldn't work for me after reading some of the other reviews. but it looks great & feels comfy."	1
"Just ordered this in a small for me (5'6"", 135, size 4) and medium for my mom (5'3"", 130, size 8) and it is gorgeous - beautifully draped, all the weight/warmth i'll need for houston fall and winter, looks polished snapped or unsnapped. age-appropriate for both my mom (60's) and myself (30's). will look amazing with skinny jeans or leggings. we ordered the gray which is true to the photos."	1
Great material, pattern and cut. perfect summer top	1
I love this sweater! the sky color is very flattering in person. i love that it looks good open or closed. i bought one for my mom and me. i think it will be very versatile. i think it runs mostly true to size, possibly runs just slightly big.	1
Girls, this dress is gorgeous.  but if you are an a/b cup, there is just too much fabric in the bust.  the entire dress is pleated from the shoulders down, so a curvier figure would be shown to great advantage in this beautiful number.  alas, i had to send it back and was very sad to do so.	1
"I loved the look of this dress online, and it's everything i hoped and more in person. i'm 5'10"", 155# and pear-shaped. while the bottom of this dress is voluminous, it definitely did not have a pregnant fit on my body shape. the length was absolutely perfect, it wasn't scratchy in the least. i got compliments on the dress all day long. wore with a pair of cowboy boots while wine tasting in napa."	1
These bottoms are super comfortable. i think they run a little big for a small. i bought another swimsuit from retailer and the bottoms are also small and fit a little better than these. it goes well with the peplum swimsuit top. im so excited about wearing them this season!!	1
I got my normal size and unfortunately the moment i tried it on the details on both shoulders ripped. the dress fit fine and i basically have no boobs so i don't think it was a case of it being too small. i guess it just wasn't reinforced enough. there was also a miss-stitch in the shoulder on the back which causes the back of the dress to bunch funnily. lastly, there's a slip on the inside which i don't think was necessary. it hugs tight to the body and makes the whole dress feel oddly clingy.	0
"First i must say that i bought this zip up hoodie because of the material and how incredibly soft and comfortable it was - absolutely worth the price. however, the sleeves were about 4"" too long! because i am a seamstress, and this was an easy hem for me i went ahead and purchased it and hemmed up the sleeves, but i was honestly shocked how long they were. you would have to have very long arms for this to fit you without alterations. if you don't mind rolling them up i suppose it might work as w"	1
Very lovely sweater - lightweight with cute detailing at the side of the waist, sweet but not saccharine bow at the back of the neck. i really wanted to love this sweater, but it had to go back because it looked, um, used. pilling along the arms before i even got to wear it? it got returned, sadly.	0
I cannot begin to tell you how much i love these jeans. i have been searching everywhere for the right pair of black jeans, and this is it. they run a little small and don't have as much give as regular pilcro jeans: i am normally a 28 in pilcro and i purchased these in a 29. the fit is wonderful and they keep their shape beautifully.	1
The fit on these is amazing and the color is great too! sometimes the fading is too much on jeans but this is just right. the rise fits really well and the length is great! love pilcro!	1
I love the texture and sheen of corduroy combined with this beautiful evergreen color. i purchased size 10 and the somewhat stretchy fit accommodates my bust size (36dd) with a blouse or slim fitting sweater quite well. i think the skirt flares out too much and ends a little too low for my height, so i'm waiting for the petite to arrive to see if it's more flattering. i picked tts but may be a bit large for those who are less busty, so you may want to size down if you're slender or pear shaped.	1
For a couple weeks, i debated making this purchase. in fear that my size would no longer be available, i ordered this lovely top. when it arrived, i was immediately disappointed with its colors...unlike the vibrant colors in the photo, the top's colors were dull...more a brown than orange and gray rather than lavender. had the fit been better, i would have kept this item despite of its color. it's cut weird! though it runs slightly large, i felt the top was ill fitted through the upper bust and	0
Color is not like photo and fit doesn't work if you're busty	0
This is such an ethereal flowing dress.more gray than light blue as it appears in pix.love the flowy bell sleeves.its a modest length just above the knee.quality a bit lower than is the retailer norm but still good.	1
"I'm 5' 2"" and 110 lbs. i ordered this in xsp but it was a lot shorter in the front than led to believe from the photo. it was also a little baggy on top. otherwise, i love the material, shimmer and overall look. i will be exchanging this for a regular xxs."	1
This is a unique take on a denim shirt! i have about five other denim shirts but love this style.	1
"I was leery when i ordered this as i read the reviews and i'm busty. it is perfect for me- just wear a little bandeau underneath! i'm 5"" 1 1/2"" ,135 lbs and 34d bra size. also the length is perfect. i'll be wearing this little number winter and summer here in fl. will look just as cute with boots and long sweater! and did i mention, it has pockets!!!!!!!"	1
First of all, this jean fits really well, but i usually wear a 31 in mother jeans and i had to go up to a 32 in these (ugh!) because they just ran smaller or whatever. i am curvy on the bottom but the 31's just felt too tight and pulled everywhere. second, the color is not quite right in this picture; it looks more military green. it is not - it is a much brighter military green vs a moss green. that is throwing me a bit. not quite as versatile or neutral to me. meanwhile, the styling with the	1
I absolutely love this top! i often shop the sale items first, but when i saw this top in the store, i didn't hesitate to pay full price. the material reminds me of vintage clothing - it is a dry clean only item, but is so special that it's worth it. the colors and construction (beautifully lined, bias trim) are impressive. and, this top looks better on me than on the model:)	1
I bought this sweater and love it! one of my favorites this season.	1
"I was looking for a stylish spring/fall jacket and this one seemed to fit the bill. i was shocked by the quality and softness of the material and construction of this jacket. i could honestly not believe how comfortable and cute this felt and looked on me. i can't wear it enough! i am a short 5'2"" but 36d and have 31"" waist so i ordered a size m and l to see which would work best. as it turned out the m fit with plenty of room! i am normally a 12/14 so i was surprised by this. if you are on the"	1
I love this blouse! the details are beautiful and and it is so versatile! i can where it with jeans and boots or slim black pants and strappy sandals and get tons of compliments every time. one of my favorite retailer purchases ever!	1
I tried this dress on and convinced myself that i didn't need it. on another visit, i tried again and couldn't resist. it is amazingly comfortable and a great alternative to shorts/jeans/pants. you can dress it up a bit with sandals vs athletic shoes but the fabric does tend toward more festive picnic or outdoor concert vs wedding. i prefer wearing dresses so this is a wonderful addition.	1
Love it. got a lot of compliments with it. buy it, it's worth it especially with the sale price right now.	1
Comfortable, flattering, one step up in formality from jammies, what more could you want?	1
I absolutely love this dress. i am 5'0 and 167 pounds and the extra large was way too big. the large was perfect. the fabric is substantial but the fit is loose and swingy so it is good for the atlanta heat and humidity. i want to wear this every day.	1
I really wanted to keep this dress, and the material is amazing, so soft and gentle and delicate, the design is great, the front looks nice, but from back looks really awkward, big and kind of too loose!	0
Awesome pants. they look a lot better in person than in these pictures. i got it in dark blue. they are very comfortable, and can be used day to night. if you like cropped pants and wide legs this one is a good option. it's a bit more dressy than other models, still look casual and fun. i may end up getting a couple more for myself...	1
I so wanted to keep this sweater but the invisible metallic threads that give the sweater its crinkled appearance are super scratchy and irritating. it definitely requires a long sleeved top to prevent the irritation as shown in the online photo. it is lightweight and i planned to wear it over sleeveless summer tops/dresses. i have averaged size arms and there was plenty of upper arm room. in fact extra room is designed into the sleeves. one plus for those with upper arm fit concerns. the lower	0
I love this dress and bought it in the store in the orange, without trying it on as i usually wear a 12 in this brand.  the over-dress is beautiful, however the under-slip is very tight and is apparently made for some one who has no bust at all.  i am so sad and am considering returning it or re-sewing the slip in some way so that it fits.  not sure what to do. don't want to spoil the color combo by wearing something different underneath, but it is so sheer you need something.	1
Not a huge fan of this dress, will be returning it. fits too big and not flattering. fabric is thin and shows any lumps and bumps you may have. color is not as pretty in person as in the photo - the photo looks like a nice rust color but the dress is actually a boring brownish olive.	0
"This fabric of this top is gorgeous. however, i'm 5' 5"" and it hits in a really weird spot. right no the point of the hip that you don't want to accentuate. you could wear it with leggings to a casual thing, but i work in an office so its too short to wear with leggings and too long to wear with jeans. sad, i love the top 90% of it."	1
"This dress is a lovely creation! however, i had to buy it three times before finding the proper fit. it runs extremely large!! i am 5'4"", weighing around 128. i ordered a 4 petite the first time because others stated this dress ran small. ha! it was a sack!!! the 2 petite was little better. the 0 petite was perfect! but i have never worn a 0 petite in my entire life! otherwise, this dress is an original that i will enjoy for many years to come! if only it had been made of silk, it would be un"	1
The velvet isn't as soft or plush as i thought it would be but these are comfy pants. i won't wear them until next winter, which is fine.	1
A romantic find. light and airy. the color is slightly darker than shown. the soft, subtle ruffles give it just the right touch.	1
I love this top in peach! i usually wear a size 8 and ended up buying the large because that was all they had in store. it fits well but loose. i usually front tuck it in. what i love the most about this top is the perfect way it slouches off your shoulders. very effortless but doesn't feel like it is falling off. a few other off the shoulder tops i tried are either falling off or rising up (and you constantly have to pull them down over your shoulders) due to elastic in the shoulder. this top h	1
Love this top! love that it ia jersey knit which makes it comfortable. love the print which makes it stand out. love the design of a side bow. i did not have an issue with the banded hem, in fact i like how it makes the top more structured.	1
I had been eyeing this coat for a few weeks after it appeared in the email, and i finally decided to purchase it to treat myself. i was very excited to get it, as it is a beautiful coat online. however, once i received it i was very disappointed. the material is much thinner than i would expect for something that cost $168, and when i went to button it the button slipped right off the thread it was sewn onto the coat with. i checked the other buttons and all of them were loose as well.  perso	0
Hack: wrap the sash around waist twice and tie in back!! agreed with other reviewers it is a bit sack like when the sash tied in front as seen on model. but wrap twice, and it makes the silhouette pop. fabric is rediculously lush, and pattern is very sophisticated. stunning dress, will be wearing all summer -- with flats for work, with heels for evening. oop, my usual size, fits perfectly (5'4, 110 lbs).	1
"I am in love with this dress. it's super soft, flattering  and comfy i want to wear it everyday. it was recommended to me by a friend who is taller and slimmer than i am so i was skeptical of the fit. sometimes you see things that are only meant for models to wear. so not true here. i am 5'3"" 140 pounds with slightly broad shoulders and i bought an xs. i'm considering getting a second one."	1
Loved this top when i first saw it online and when it arrived it didn't disappoint at all. dress it up or down.	1
This is one of the best purchases i've ever made... i have had the black for over a year, and every time i wear it, i receive so many complements. i've dressed it up with a striped scooped back shirt, or a fitted sweater, and paired it with flannel with a belt... i love it. i'm 6' ft and slender, and the xs it hits me at the perfect length just below the knee. i recently ordered the silver in a small (it's a little big in the waist- but nothing a corset belt can't help) for nye. love this dress!	1
"I just received this sweater in the mail and when i first opened the packaging i questioned as to whether or not they sent to correct color. be aware that this ""brown"" is actually gray. i checked the site to see if it was even offered in gray, which it is not. additionally, the sweater is quite a bit shorter than the picture on the model implies. i still love it, the comfy coziness of it will be great for fall in new england. looking forward to wearing it."	1
I love the look of this dress but wish the bottom was lined like the top is. it's a little sheer without the lining.	1
This vest is cute. the colors are as pictured, and the lace detail on the back is adorable. it is summery and versatile. however, it was really big on me. i usually wear and xs, but it just swallowed me. now i have to consider whether to exchange for an xs petite.	1
I loved the style when i saw it online and even more in person. the fabric is light but not too light. it has a nice drape i didn't expect. easy to wear and style. the draw string gives it a great shape but a belt is a great addition for more interest. the length is fantastic as well. wonderful midi length but with the side slits.	1
I was headed out of my local retailer store when i spotted this beauty! i had been looking for a dress/tunic like this for some time. i got the lovely soft grey/white combo and it is lovely on. normally an xl in tops from retailer the large in this holding horses tunic fit perfect! also a note for women with bigger arms and shoulders this should work well for you as this is usually a problem for me and not the case with this piece! easily dresses up or down, both jeans and leggings work well	1
The lace detail is very classy. a great go to white dress.	1
I had my eye on this dress for months. i came into some extra cash and bought it at full price online and picked it up in the store. the purple pattern is nowhere near as soft as pictures. it was very bright which disappointed me. it's also made for more busty women. at a 34d i could in no way fill this dress out. the result made it look so frumpy and unflattering. i felt like an old lady in a bag.	0
Tts. i'm 38c, 8-10 and m fits just right. nice and fitted at the top, flowy skirt. i got the cream and love the skirt pattern.	1
This top is so cute and of spectacular quality, but you have to size up! i'm a 10/m/34c all the time. i almost never have to size up or down. but this top was so tight around the bust that i couldn't possibly have closed the zipper in the back. i'm sending it back for a l in the hopes of a better fit. the coloring of the owls is out-of-this-world cute, so i'm keeping my fingers crossed that a larger size will be just right.	1
Fits very strange. odd cut. does not look well on.	0
"I purchased the tan ""ish"" gray colored one in xs. it looks a bit mauve in the pictures, but is still very beautiful.. i like the drape of the fabric and the cats on the front. the one drawback is that the arms are very snug, especially the upper arm and chest. i have not worn it yet and am debating whether or not to exchange for the next size up. just have to get to my area retailer before they sell out of the size small."	1
I absolutely love this bra-it is the most comfortable, aesthetically pleasing sports bra i have ever owned. i love the straps! they take some patience to get aligned properly once the bra is one, but afterward it looks amazing. the bra itself is soft and the padded inserts actually stay in place without much manipulation so they are aligned properly. when moving, i do not have any areas that rub or get irritated uncomfortably. i absolutely love this bra. it gives me the support i need for a high	1
This bra is the one. i have been searching high and low to replace my worn out comfy bra, and this is it. if you are looking for a wireless bra with thin straps that can peek out from your shirt and not announce themselves as hello bra straps, a v-neck cut (none of that scoop cut nonsense), and you don't care about trying to boost your cleavage, this bra has it all. so comfy too.	1
I agree with the other review. the fabric and pattern are adorable and well made. the fabric is not sheer at all and great quality;however, the shirt is very wide. i am a 34/26/36 and the small is way too big. the arm holes are perfect but the bottom is uncomfortably large and awkward in appearance.	0
"This dress is beautiful. this is a 0 and tts. it was not clingy or tight at all (5'4"" 115lbs). it is fully lined, and i have short legs, so it was not too short for me. if you have an event you could wear this to this summer, i highly recommend."	1
"I rarely order pants on line...as the size often varies so much. took a chance on these as they were on sale and they are just stink'n adorable! i am so glad i did, i love them. i ordered both colors, haven't got the neutral pair yet but the green plaid fits me like they were made for me!! for reference i am about 5""3' tall, my weight is around 137.5 ish. i ordered the 28 regular, and they fit perfectly. i hope they don't stretch to much when i wear them. if so i will update my review. i just lo"	1
This is so adorable and flattering. dress it up or down with a denim jacket weekday to weekend.w/flats or pumps. love this cute dress. not all wool so it's not itchy at all. the colors are vibrant and would compliment any complexion!	1
I love this shirt! great fabric, nice quality, flattering fit. i have gotten this shirt in 4 colors. my only complaint is that the color names do not match the actual color.. not sure who named these. the orange is a lovely burgundy, and the white is actually oatmeal.	1
I love the style of this dress and the color is beautiful and very much like the photo. like previous reviewers mentioned, the top is a little loose in comparison to the bottom. i originally bought a size 4 but then exchanged it for a 2. i tend to be between those sizes. the 2 fits great on bottom but the straps are a bit loose. it might be better for bigger busted ladies!	1
I received this for christmas this year and have already worn it several days in a row. it is warm enough to wear while walking the dog in the snow and can also be worn to lounge around the house. the only reason i didn't rate it a 5 is due to the design fact that it doesn't have pockets. i don't love to carry a purse around all of the time so i use my coat pockets a lot. regardless though i would definitely recommend this especially for the price. i was expecting to come here and see this pric	1
Love the blouse and the best part is the back side ! this brand never ceases to fall short for fit and style. try it on to see	1
I got this dress in hopes of having a really nice winter formal dress. it was not well made at all! the lining didn't line up with the top layer and the waist puffed out in uneven places. i am curvy so a puffy waistline in the last thing i need! the fabric itself is very nice, but just not well made. i do not recommend this dress.	0
This shirt fits great. it is a fun look. i wore it wear a pair of leggings and sneakers for a casual day look. it goes down to my knees in the back and the front is asymmetric. so cute. i think i will get a lot of use out of this going forward.	1
These looked super cute online and i was excited about getting them. i wanted that slightly baggy look to be able to carry them off similar to the model. so i referred to the size chart and ordered the size that said it would allow this. based on the size chart for this item...it is wrong. i should have had extra room. instead they were tight around the hips. i measured my hips before ordering and i am a seamstress....so i know where and what to measure. this is a nice quality product though...j	1
I loved the beautiful print! the sleeves were beautiful as well and added a unique quality to the shirt. i also liked the longer length of the shirt. i ordered online and kept it!	1
Bought this today and i'm in love!! very flattering, great fit!	1
I love this shirt! red + navy is one of my fave color combos, and the vintage feel is fantastic. the fabric is a little thicker and more sweater-like than i was expecting, but it's a good thing. the top isn't heavy, but the knit gives it more texture & interest. this is the perfect thing to throw on for a casual sexy look...covered, but form-fitting and flattering.	1
This is such a soft, comfortable and well fitting blazer. i love the structured cut of a material that is usually used in more casual designs. i look forward to wearing it very often in the fall. so glad i purchased this one!	1
Very soft! i sized up. was able to wear without a cami underneath	1
I read the reviews before i bought this sweater online. one person did mention that the side slits were cut very high, but i had no idea! when i tried the xs on at home i was quite surprised by just how high up those side slits were. with just a pair of jeans, you could see flesh! at first i thought it maybe wouldn't work, but i decided to keep it because everything else about the sweater is lovely. i'll be layering this with a tank underneath. it's a bit quirky and funky and that appeals to me!	1
"I bought two pair in one week...crazy right? i am 5'11 and 150lbs. i bought the pink color, soft faded pink, which drew me to them right away...kinda soft and romantic pink. then two days later went back (one hour drive) and bought the silver which is really a worn in green color. i feel these are true to size, i wouldn't size down because these are""t super stretchy....feels like it also won't bag out during the day. i really love these cords....and the rolled up cuff is adorable."	1
"Fell in love with these instantly in the dressing room. it was more than i wanted to spend but i don't regret it. quality is great, denim is just the right thickness, i love the wash... will be wearing these a lot. just like my other pilcros!  i'm 5'8"" 125 lbs. size 28 fits perfect and the length is just right."	1
Love this gorgeous fox skirt. i typically wear either a size 4 or 6 depending on cut. i bought the small and it fit perfectly. i wore it with a black turtleneck sweater and black tights/boots. other colored tops would work, as well, due to the various flower colors around the fox - pink, yellow, blue, white or brick red. i'd prefer it to be a little warmer/lined.	1
Perfect for work or a night out. packing for europe, wore it out on a saturday night with leggings and heels. layer it after yoga got it in all colors love	1
"I ordered this in the orange color from online. they were sold out of petite so i ordered medium (regular). i liked it, but just not flattering. i am 5'2"" and the coat was too big. sleeves were past my hands. i think because i'm ""curvy"" the straight cut of coat would not have looked good on me in a size small. it was a nice coat, just not for me."	0
I live in these shorts all summer long. they are so comfortable, soft and practical. i have purchased a couple of these every summer but this year they were so many pretty colors i ended up with 6 new pair.. they go with just about everything and are soft and perfect for texas heat. i stayed true to size on them.	1
I love this dress! i was worried it would swallow my petite frame but it is flowy yet flattering. i have worn it to several different occasions. it looks great with tights and boots and just flats. the lace detailing makes it unique.	1
"I was lucky enough to get a hold of this intarsia sweater dress after the sale and i wish i had purchased this the first time round. it is absolutely stunning, flattering, comfortable and unique! i am 5'3"" and the regular hem fit me just fine at the ankles. i think this dress runs both tts to a bit large so i would size down if your small framed and stay your usual if your busty or broad shouldered. perfectly complements my taupe booties that i already owned and a my taupe maxi sweater that has"	1
I simply love this jacket. it's comfortable, soft and has a relaxed fit that is easy to wear. i wish i had bought mine while it was on sale.	1
I'm a b-cup who hates traditional underwire bras, so i was excited to try this one out. while i appreciate that this bra has more structure and support than other wireless comfy bras, the cups provided too much coverage for my style. if you want to wear a shirt with a wide neck, or do a cute off-the-shoulder thing with your shirt, the top of the cup shows. bummer!	0
This dress is very lightweight and great for fall/spring weddings. i received several compliments all night! sits very nice on the waist as well!	1
I got this new dress for a work meeting and instantly received compliments. it has a very unique pattern that is perfect for the office or date night. it is a little long and falls below the knee, but otherwise the dress fits and feels great. the fabric has a nice weight, so it covers any imperfections you might want to hide.	1
"I ordered a m and l based on the reviews - and both were too big. this is a drapey top with large arm(pit) openings. i have since ordered a small and hope this fits well. in general, this top is beautiful. i usually wear a 4/6 or s/m top/blouse and am 5'8"" with a slim build. the m should have fit better than it did."	1
These leggings are beautiful and different. the material is very stretchy, sort of a spandex feel. panty lines definitely show in the back. i found they run true to size; i wear a size 6/medium/28 in pants or jeans and the size medium fit me great.	1
"I love this pant. it is so soft and has some stretch in it. the first pair i tried in a size 10 and the sales associate suggested trying a size 12 as ithis pant should not fit tight as it is a trouser. tie 12 is perfect. it reminds me of a ""retro"" pant,which i love."	1
It doesn't work with me only because i have very skinny arm. i can not handle the arm part of the dress. it is still very pretty though. i would keep it if i fit the arm :(	1
Beautiful dress. good quality. tts. i'm 5 feet 120 lbs. ordered my small petite. no issues. however, the green is very bright. the deal killer for me was when my hub said it looked like a starbucks barista's apron! it's going back. i marked yes if you plan on purchasing a black dress it's a yes.	1
I just purchased these jeans on-line in my regular petite size 27 (27-35-116lbs) as that's the size i almost always order but ended up exchanging them for the next size up and found the 28's to feel much more comfortable so i'd suggest sizing up one size. the jeans run a bit tight in the thigh and waist area and though i could also get away with wearing the 27's, i just personally prefer the fit of the 28's better. these jeans give a nice shape in the back, are super soft and are the same color	1
"I've been looking for a mid-weight, shrug-on cardigan for a while now and i've finally found the one! as a petite (5'4"", 130 lbs) lady with big boobs, i hate clingy cardigans with buttons since they are just so unflattering.  luckily this cardigan is warm without being stifling, fitted in the sleeve without being impossible to wear over clothes with different-length sleeves, and perfectly cut to slim even thought it is shrug-y. i especially like the back details, which are even more curve-fla"	1
"The wide strap style is very flattering. this tank is fitted in my normal size small, it fits like the model in the cobalt blue color. i'm 5'7"" 120lbs. if you want more room, i'd size up. it is low cut, but not inappropriately so. fits like the picture shows."	1
Such a lovely shirt and even though it is white, flowing and delicate it is not see-through so you will not have to worry about wearing an undershirt in the summer sun. lovely top!	1
Really cute romper that can be dressed up or down. super comfortable and flattering. i ordered the xs and it fit perfect.	1
The pattern of this skirt is adorable and looks better in person but the fabric isnt the best. it feels like an elastic fabric and is way to volumous. overall not my favorite.	1
I love the look of this right away. i found it ran small to retailer's clothes (where i'm inexplicably a xs or s here i was a m). i also am a dd, so would have appreciated more support, but as the other reviewer, i can get away with it to wear this cute suit.	1
Nice weight sweater that allows one to wear leggings or ultra skinny jeans without looking like i'm pregnant (not that there's anything wrong with that) very feminine and light weight enough to wear with a cami underneath and a pretty scarf.	1
Love it!! it does run big so i had to return for smaller size. fabric is nice very true to picture	1
"I ordered this dress in a size 6. for reference i am 5'7"", 145 lbs. i love it! the fit is perfect. unlike other reviews, i was aware the hem was unfinished, and i like the look. the top part does not seem to short. the style, to me is kinda retro. i wore the dress with flip-flops and a large chunky necklace. i received lot's of compliments, it is my favorite dress right now!"	1
Ordered it in small regular and xtra small petite. what was surprising was that the xtra small petite fit better (meaning more room) across the chest. i'm normally a medium or medium petite, but this runs large. if you're unsure of a size, get both and return the one that doesn't fit as well. it's much better in person and looks very rich in colors and quality. the only complaint i have is there were some loose yarn pieces just dangling off the edges. i trimmed up with scissors and they didn't e	1
I bought the blazer in the grey motif color. it is definitely a taupe color versus grey but it does look as pictured.i bought a small after trying it on in store. i think it runs a bit small as i mostly wear xs at retailer. the arms are very fitted in my opinion, so if you have bigger arms, it might feel too snug. you don't really see this detail in the picture but the lapel folds differently on each side, meaning one folds back higher than the other, so it isn't a symmetrical look. i actually lik	1
This dress is even better in person. the base color of the fabric is a very light peach, and very lovely. as you can see from the photos, the green floral pattern running up the front of the dress varies slightly from dress to dress, but i found the front on mine was very similar to the 1st photo. the bright green flowers are a light mint green, which plays beautifully with the light peach. there are more details in the print to discover in person, which is a nice bonus. the silk is not stiff li	1
I love the colors, the material, the design details (especially the white pattern at the end of the sleeves). the sweater is super soft and cosy. i got it in s because i wanted it to be nicely fitted. i am on tops between s and m. i am of tall , narrow build and athletic, which means i have well developed but still slim muscles in my chest, arms and shoulders. to accomadate that i often need m even though the rest of me is an s ;). anyhow, i was a bit surprised. in s the sweater fits very snug i	1
I want to address that with lightweight but not too skimpy for the summertime, and the stress works perfectly. i got the red in a small, and although one reviewer said that she did not like that the top and bottom are two different materials i actually think it's super cute. not sure if i would pay the full price, but the 20% off sale made it worth it.	1
"I finally pressed 'go' on the orange dress during the weekend sale. the dress is terrific. i am a busty (36dd) size 8/10 and the m fits perfectly. based on the reviews, i had planned to take this to the tailor to take in the armholes, but it is not necessary at all - no bra showing in front or back. i am 5'6"" and the shortest part of the hem is about 2"" above my knee. there is no lining, so i might add a short pull-on slip depending on where i wear it, but otherwise this is an easy dress to be w"	1
I loved the look of these pants in the pictures online and i loved the way that they fit. however when i got my pair, the flower placement was completely different. the whole front was black and there were just flowers running out of the crotch seams. i ordered another pair hoping they were just cut wrong, but those were even worse. they looked obscene.	0
"I loved this top when i first saw it online and it did not disappoint when i received it in the mail. it's very lightweight, perfect for spring, cool summer night, early fall. i really like the design and like that you can tuck it in. there is enough fabric in the front to give it a ""flowy"" look that i appreciate bc i will be giving birth soon and my post baby body will likely need some coverage! great top!"	1
These shorts are divine. the fabric is sturdy and there is a weave of sparkle that i did not perceive from the picture.	1
Love, love, love. like another chambray item i have, they feel stuff and rough after washing, but once you put them on, they soften up and look great.	1
"These pants are beautiful. great fit and great fabric. really comfortable and elegant. i am tall 5'8"" and have a long torso so it's nice to find pants that are high waisted."	1
I bought this dress in blue. it's a light jersey material, but it is lined. i find it very flattering. i have found more occasions to wear it than i expected.	1
All of my friends loved these pants- as did i! these are so gorgeous. the sequins seem well stitched. the small fit me well- hanging straight as pictured, not too snug or uncomfortable. they hit me at the ankle. there are back pockets.	1
"No lycra in this skirt says my label, ignore the website description. it's 100% cotton so no stretch. me: 28-29"" waist and 36"" hips. the medium is a snug fit on my true waist. i love it and will be tucking in shirts / tees when i wear it. otherwise it seems true to the pictures, dark and long. the slit opens above my knees (i'm 5'6""). the pockets are in a kind of odd position in the very front but the trick of that is they add no bulk to hips so...it's a win!"	1
"I ordered this on line. pretty, but ran large so returning. i am 5'10"" and 140lbs., not large chested, and the m was too loose and looked frumpy. the sweater is a very soft, loose, knit that requires a cami underneath as it is slightly sheer. it was not quite as soft as expected for cashmere but good value at sale price."	1
This is a great top and it fit me very nicely but it's much longer than it appear to be in the picture. i'm 5'2 and it was more like a tunic than a tank on me. if it were shorter it would be one of my favorite staples i'm sure. if you're very tall i think you will love it.	1
Adorable jacket. i ordered the medium (5'4, 135 lbs). sleeves are long and have to roll them up. ordering the petite medium to see if it fits better. pink color is great.	1
Love these socks!!! i need to get more colors, they look so good on with boots with the lace showing!	1
After reading the previous review, i was pretty confident in ordering this dress. it arrived in the mail today, and i was so disappointed. first of all, it's huge. the medium was way too big on me, and i'm never a small at retailer! (i even considered ordering the large in this - my normal size at retailer.) second, the colors are not as vibrant as in the photo, and the fabric felt cheap. finally, it just looked like i went to hawaii and bought a drab dress there that didn't fit right.	0
This dress is most definitely not a maxi! barely goes below the knees. also you do not get the cute detail shown on bodice. there are no folds which were an added plus on picture. waist is higher, not at natural waist. very pretty silk though and still cute. just not as pictured.	1
This sweater looked so promising with the tie waist and pretty lacy edging, but turned out to be a disappointment. it was much shorter than it looks in the photos and barely came to my hips. and the plum color was much darker than i expected, more of a dull brownish-burgundy.	0
Being a 34d, i was nervous about the gaping between the top two buttons given the other reviews i read. they're right - it totally gaps even when standing still. so i took it to the tailor. they sewed the seam between the top two buttons. easy fix for a blouse that otherwise works. the color is great (i got the red one) and i like the fabric. i didn't think it hit awkwardly at the bottom seam. looks great with skinny white jeans.	1
I was excited to see this sweater in my local store. i have been coveting it online. it was just as pretty in person as i hoped it would be.  the color is vivid and beautiful. i loved the buttons down the back.  i usually wear a size small but they only had an extra small. i tried it on and liked the way it fit. i wanted a snugger look. i think the small would have worked too, just a looser feel. the fabric is very soft. now just waiting for cooler weather so i can wear it.	1
I love these pants! so comfortable and the material is so soft.	1
I love this feminine blouse and the gorgeous colors on! it's a fresh shape that is truly flattering. i like that it comes in specific sizes so the proportions seem accurate. i bought the 8 in peach; all the colors are very pretty. i am a usual 8/medium and am 34f, so the regular bra-friendliness is essential. this is a new, fuller shape for me. i'm on a quest at this time of year for clothing that feels comfortable in the beginning heat of summer, and this is a lovely choice. you could pair it w	1
I was excited to buy this sweater based on the online pictures.  although the ombre coloring is beautiful in person, i did not like the metallic trim at waist & cuffs.  the pictures don't really show the extreme brightness of the trim.  it looks literally like xmas ribbons were sewn into the sweater.  to me it looked like something a child would wear.  i ordered the 1, which was the smallest size offered.  it is oversized without much shape and i felt it added bulk around the middle.	1
I loved this top so much i bought it in both colors. i have not seen anyone complain about this, but on me, the mock neck collapses in and looks messy. unfortunately i returned both. i sew, and i do not understand why this happened.	1
This should have been cute, but the fabric choice + ruching design made me look like i had elephant skin rippling around my waist -- super unflattering.	0
This dress is really nice and lightweight. the slip is snug so the outer part floats nicely. but..it adds a bit too much volume if you have a lot of curves. it disguises in a way but also is a bit less flattering. i really wanted to like it because it's so breezy but a tad matronly on me.	1
Pants fit great. true to size. did not stretch like some of the retailer pants that you need to buy in a smaller size. love that the calf is bigger than most of their pants which are usually too narrow for my bigger calves. very comfy look great with a white shirt and tie die is subtle. they will be a staple summer pair of pants.	1
Bought both colors in xs and soooooo glad i did. this dress is absolutely gorgeous in either color... will have (do to the nice quality) and wear (very stylish) for a loooooong time. a must have for the summer!!!!!!	1
I had this on my birthday list and was really hopeful that it'd work out based on all of the good reviews. when i got it, i was happy with the fit and fabric, but i was stumped as to what i'd wear it with. it hung in the closet for a couple of weeks because i just didn't know if i could pull off the length. i took the plunge today and find it pairs nicely with a flared leg pant and simple shirt underneath. it's so stretchy, warm, and cozy! the sweater does shed as another reviewer mentioned so k	1
This top is really pretty and nice quality. runs big - i went down a size, and its perfect. coloring is more subtle in person than in the photo.	1
I wanted to love this top. perfect weight, length, and shape. unfortunately, the seam goes right through the bust and just does not look right. if you are tiny on top, this will be lovely on you.	0
Purchased this top at my local store and it is very flattering! not to boxy, hits at the hip and drapes nice. great for work or with jeans. i purchase the navy faux fur scarf to wear around the neck and wow!	1
"Given that tunics and thigh-length dresses are the hot new thing this season, i kept finding that my black-only-tights collection wasn't going to fly with my cute new tops and boots. so i searched far and wide for different colored tights that didn't look cheap or inauthentic in color, and found these. i bought them in blue, gray, and brown and i have worn them with so many different pieces! they look more ""rustic"" than the average tight, almost like they are leggings, not tights. they are a lit"	1
This color is gorgeous. this could be dressed up or down. great buy!	1
I already have some dresses similar to this, but i couldn't help getting this one, too. i love the flowers, bees, and ladybugs on the print! there is some shimmery beading on the neck and a few spots. i think i can wear this at work with the right cardigan/jacket, so i'll get more use out of it. it's a lovely light, floaty fabric that's nice for warmer weather.	1
Loved these in store when i tried them on but was in between sizes so i ordered them in the larger size. boy do i regret that! these stretch out so much i have to wear a belt with them and it gives me this saggy bunchy front when i sit...not attractive. wish i could return them, but i took the tag off and wore them not knowing this before hand!! if in between sizes definitely size down.	0
I so wanted to love this dress, despite the reviews. when i opened the package i fell in love with the fabric. the print is absolutely beautiful and the fabric feels luxurious. the dress fit perfectly but there was just too much fabric (even though i absolutely loved the fabric). the flowing overlay was just too much. i am returning it.	0
This shirt is really pretty but the sleeves are so small. i normally wear between a 4 to a 6 or a size medium and i could not get this shirt on. i wish it fit but a size large would have been way to long and loose.	1
This jacket runs very large. i usually wear an xl but probably could fit into a medium. i have long arms, and the sleeves were way past my hands. i love the jacket, but it's just too sloppy.	1
I purchased this jacket in my local store. size 10 and runs really small . i love the color combination and design but the fabric in my opinion is poor quality. i have seen a lot of retailer use this poly spun knit in so much of their items and the jacket after bringing it home and looking in the light was already showing pilling. looks like it is worn in an bad way. returned the next day. this was a big disappointment and every time i see this fabric being used in retailer clothes it makes me mad.	0
I took a chance on this top because i loved the color and print. it is mostly as pictured, but because i have a larger chest, the peplum didn't hit me in the right place. it would probably work fine for someone thinner with a smaller chest. i was surprised that it was also somewhat sheer, which was disappointing considering the price. i returned it.	0
I just received them (blue) and wore them today. i got so many compliments! they are comfy and very flattering. i would not call the fabric cheap at all. it is super soft and washes and wears nicely. i ordered the medium and they fit perfectly, even though i am on the large side of medium. i'm ordering the other color right now!	1
I bought this in both yellow and green. what a gorgeous and flatttering top that fits beautifully. i love this top!	1
These are called jeans but they aren't exactly jean material. they are black with a nice stretch to the fabric. a bit tighter on the thighs than the flare jeans but the stretch to the fabric makes it work. i like these very much, a very slimming effect. mid rise- which looks very chic.highly recommend!	1
I rarely write reviews, but this one deserves one. this top is completely, utterly, adorable! it flows so beautifully, which makes it perfect to wear with leggings/skinny jeans. i wore mine with a blazer for a work holiday party, and i received so many compliments. this top makes you feel so feminine and pretty. i love the maeve brand, and this is certainly no exception! i'd love to get it in multiple colors!	1
"I purchased this shirt in two colors. it was a bit longer than i was expecting. i'm curvy  5' 2"" 180 lbs 36dd and the large fit perfectly."	1
I bought this dress to wear to one of the upcoming events leading up to my wedding in mexico. it's the perfect mix of casual yet refined. as another reviewer mentioned, it is a bit tight through the bust, but luckily i wasn't blessed in that area. i would caution that there is absolutely no stretch to this dress. it's a true, straight shift. i'm going to rock it with turquoise and flats in mexico.	1
Dressed up or dressed down, this summer dress is perfect. the skirt is a lot of fabric, like others have said, but it's part of what makes this dress fun; and because the top is fitted, i find it very flattering because you can adjust the tie around the waist to make it fitted. that being said, the design sort of threw me off when it arrived in the mail because the waist as well as straps around the shoulders are adjustable; at first it looked like a sack, but when it's on and adjusted it will l	1
I've had this jacket for a few weeks and it has been a terrific transition piece for the spring. this is a lightweight layering piece without any lining. it works well as a topper for cooler morning temps and you can still wear it later in the day without perspiring through it. i bought it in the olive color, which works with just about everything and the xs was tts (for reference-5'4,116 lbs.). the fit is slightly boxy with a nice swing and drape in the back. for those concerned about the back	1
If you've been searching for red crops, gotta give these a try!! i bought my normal size 6 and they fit perfectly! they're a little more snug on me in the butt and thigh than on the model, but they're super flattering and the color is wonderful!! fabric is a tad thin, really stretchy (in a good way), and the weight is great for summer. i haven't worn them yet, so i'm not sure if they'll keep they're shape. fingers crossed!	1
I love the look of peplum tops, i think they are very forgiving, and they do a fantastic job of hiding my residual baby weight while still allowing me to look like i have an amazing figure (not washed out figure). i have several peplum tops, but most of them are made out of a thicker fabric and they don't have much movability. i absolutely love this one because it is a more casual design and much more comfortable than i am used to while still keeping the integrity of the peplum design. the fabri	1
I'm 5'5 and curvy body shape, bought size 6 because i want it to be a bit loose, turns out i could go with size 4 too, beautiful detail, and amazing fabric. this come with a crop tank top to go inside the lace blouse.	1
I ordered these jeans on sale based on the great reviews, but when the arrived the color looked different from the online pictures. i don't love the color but decided to try them on anyway since i've never tried ag before. well they are so soft and comfortable and fit great! i didn't want to take them off, so i ended up keeping them. now ag is my favorite brand for jeans!	1
I feel in love when i tried it on! i'm 5'2 an usually have to hem long dresses - but this on fits perfectly. it's full length on me -it's shorter on the model but i think it looks better full length. and it's a gorgeous burgundy. soft and comfortable. can't wait to wear it!	1
This blouse is so pretty and well made. it will be a new favorite with dark jeans and boots. it is very boho and a lovely blouse to feel dressed up a bit on a jeans day. loose in a flattering way (it does not look like a maternity top). very happy!	1
This is a go with everything throw on sweater coat that is very soft and flattering on. the fit is true to size for a swing coat. being a heather black helps with the no show of lint. i will wear this no doubt for years to come. thanks retailer.!!!	1
It was hard for me to pay full price for basic white button-down but i am so glad i did. the high-low and split back detail give the shirt a unique look. it looks cute with jeans and wedges as a dressed down option. i bought this to go with the shoreline skirt and it looked really good together. this is a staple that can be worn multiple times and for many years.	1
I'm not nearly as tall as the model so these hit right just right for flats. i love the fit of the wide leg and found the color matching the photo and the light color cords very soft. i did try the blue color on at a different store and found them a bit short. i'm really pleased with these and the sale on sale certainly helped.	1
"After reading the reviews, these leggings seemed to be the best leggings ever. i'm usually not a leggings gal, but decided these might be the ones to take me through winter with long cozy sweaters. i read the profile of those who purchased and were happy with the fit before making my purchase. i'm 5'2"", 134lbs and bought a medium. while they fit nicely through the waist and thighs, from the knees down they're baggy and really don't fit like a legging. in the photo you can see some slack around t"	1
I had such high hopes for this blouse, as it looks totally stunning online. however, it's not as pictured/described in that it is totally sheer and the brand is not floreat, but rather hd in paris. for the price, the quality is just not there...i've seen comparable shirts at other stores for much less. i returned it without a second thought.	0
The fabric and detailing of this dress is of superior quality, but unfortunately it runs huge-- you definitely need to wear a tank or cami underneath. i am 5'9 145lbs with massive shoulders/smaller bust and i got the xs petite!	1
I love the bright floral print flanking the solid white middle in this top. with its swing style and large arm holes i think i could have sized down and been ok, but i usually wear a cami with my tanks so the arm holes are not an issue. also, it has a touch of spandex in it which make it extra comfy. overall, a darling top!	1
I was very excited to get this but very disappointed once it arrived. the fabric on the back is thin and clingy. i think you'd have to wear a slip underneath. cute design on the front but sadly it's going back.	0
I ordered two sizes up, after reading reviews and added a belt for waist definition. it is long...i am six feet tall and it is perfect for me. this is absolutely beautiful; my husband loves the floral print, and i received countless compliments after one wear. the light, flowing material swayed and billowed in the breeze of the outdoor wedding i attended. very feminine and enjoyable to wear. pricey, but i felt i could wear spring through autumn. love! <3	1
Absolutely love these. i ordered them in bronze and i'm thinking about getting the lilac pair as well. they're super comfortable and look great on.	1
This dress has so much potential- loved the pattern and the neckline. however, only one side of the waist was gathered with a fake sash leaving the other side plain. the gathered side was super flattering while the other side showed any little lump or bump. needless to say, i'm returning it.	0
Great top, cuter in person with details than looks in picture. i found it to be true to size though i was worried it might be too boxy and wide. it was great, very cute! i do mostly plan on tucking it in with skirts.	1
This is a great dress for summer and very flattering!  i am 5'4 and could have pulled off the regular length but chose to go with the petite so that i could wear flats.	1
This top is gorgeous! the print is lovely and the material and cut are well constructed. can't wait to wear!	1
I wanted to love this dress. sadly, the styling was wrong. the stripes on the bottom half did not line up with the top and the pleats didn't help. it just threw everything off and made me look distorted.	0
I stalked this sold out product for weeks hoping my size would become available. when it did, i was very excited, in fact i ordered both a s and xs to be sure one sweater would fit me! unfortunately, neither did and i felt the actual sweater was not as pictured. the sweater has an overall baggy fit and the cutouts don't fall as neatly and as evenly on both shoulders as the picture shows, making the look a bit sloppy in my opinion. it is such a shame as this look is very of the moment and the mod	0
Amazing, beautiful dress that is very slimming and elegant, while casual. but it is only for smaller busted women! i have a medium and am a 34c - it's tight and pulls strangely. i've seen that comment elsewhere. i tried on the large and it was too big everywhere but the bust.	1
I'm super into this top! i bought the evergreen color in store as it fit true to size and was very flattering. i went to buy an item that was available online only and decided to also buy this top in black. my favorite aspect about this shirt is that it can be dressed up or down. the material is slightly stretchy though it does not cling. i can wear a chunky necklace and dressy skinny pants and look ready for a nice dinner. on the other hand, this top can be thrown on with a pair of comfy jeans	1
"I wore this jumpsuit to a newport wedding and got so many compliments! i'm 5'2"" 105 lbs and the 0 petite was perfect with heels."	1
I bought the bronze color which was nice but the cut just hung like a dust rag, no fit , no drape very unfinished looking. though i bought it on sale on sale, it is not worth keeping. over all it was not a worthwhile blouse to keep.	0
This dress is stunning! the quality is impeccable and the craftsmanship is stunning. i ordered my typical size and it was snug but sizing up would not have worked. this may be the most beautiful high quality piece i've ever seen at retailer!	1
This dress is perfect for any occasion, it looks great with every shoe and is flattering on.	1
I received this top in white, last fri., and have already worn it twice. it is the perfect top for hot weather because it doesn't cling to the body. the top layer is flowy and breathable. i plan on buying the blue one next to get me through the warm weather months.	1
I bought about 20 dresses online in an attempt to find a few dresses for derby week in kentucky.  this was one of the 2 that made the cut. i'm usually a 6, and i bought a 6. it fit like it was tailor made for me. i questioned if it was too tight at first, but decided it was just right and felt great in it for a full day at the track. it was comfy. it almost felt like it had built in spanx. i didn't have to wear a bra and it gave me great lift, almost like a bustier. i got so many compliments, mu	1
I am obsessed with the off the shoulder trend this season. i were mind on the shoulders so its work appropriate, and you can still tuck it in. the length is perfect. the colors are awesome. t paired it with a pair of pilco cords. it easily work with a skirt or dress pants. i would highly recommend!!!	1
When i wore this the two times i did, i got a ton of compliments. it runs small, and is a bit tight when sized correctly but its really stunning. after the second wear, the fabric under the arms frayed and its now unwearable. i have to return it and am so disappointed. sadly, i would not recommend buying it for that reason.	0
"This top is just as pretty in person as it is online. i usually buy petites, but ordered this one in the regular length and i'm glad i did. perfect on me at 5'2"". my usual size medium fit great everywhere else too. love their fabric choice as well. i'm getting really tired of the thin cottons and slub jersey materials being used so often now. deletta made my day once again!!!"	1
These jeans are so adorable and so soft--i really wish they fit! unfortunately, even the next size up was too snug for me.	1
"I wore this dress to an outdoor farm wedding and it was perfect. it runs small (i'm 5'5"" 125lbs with 34c bust) and i got a size 6. i tried on blue and pink, both were great but the blue won me over. it wrinkles easily so i had to use an iron on low to medium beforehand. will wear many more times!"	1
This dress is of great quality and design. the lines and the way the dress shapes your body are perfect throughout the entire dress. i am short and it is a little long on me; it is between my calf and my ankle, but the way it flatters in the bust and waist more than makes up for it. with the right shoes, it is a real winner! i think this dress would be flattering on every body type. highly recommend!	1
I love this dress! i wore it to my friends bridal shower and got so many compliments! i can't wait to wear it again!	1
This is a unique beautiful dress and it fits like a glove.	1
I'm very picky about jumpers, and this one is abolutely perfect! i love how it looks like a dress at first glance. it runs a little big because of the oversized fit it is supposed to have, i sized down because of the armpit area. nude garments and you'll be fine. this is going to sell out fast, don't wait for it to go on sale! (seriously my store is already out of xs's)	1
This coat is gorgeous. the minute i saw it online i ordered as fast as i can type! when it arrived it exceeded my expectations in every way. the lace detail is exquisite and the fit is so flattering. i have the beatrice coat of last year and i so love it and this is equally beautiful. a must for retailer shoppers.  i ordered my usual size and it fits to perfection.	1
I can never resist a peter pan collar, so i bought this top in the ivory. it's so cute! i wore it for the first time today and received many compliments. it's very comfortable, fits well, and looks expensive. highly recommend it!	1
"I love ag for their soft, stretchy denim and flattering fit. bought these today and couldn't be happier! i usually order stevies in the petite ankle size, but the ""regular"" capri length fit perfectly skimmed my ankle."	1
Love this dress! sadly, it ran so large that it was literally falling off of me. because i bought it on sale, the option wasn't there to buy a smaller one. the quality is excellent and it's perfect for a spring or summer day in miami:-) sorry to have had to return it due to the sizing issue.	1
This sweater is gorgeous. it is soft and i love the button detail down the sides of the sleeves. i would have loved the blue color but it was sold out, so i settled for the soft peach color. it is a very pretty sweater and looks nice on.	1
This one totally worked for me. love the color, length, and style.	1
"This dress has a unique watercolor-like pattern and design and is silk, but as another reviewer mentioned it is unlined so you probably would want to add your own slip. the side slits come up high, almost to the hip. i am 5'1"" and bought the petite xs and it comes all the way down to my toes if i don't wear a belt. if i belt it, the length is more like one would expect from a maxi dress. i am a little puzzled as to where i would wear this because the length and fancy sleeves make it seem more fo"	1
I ordered the floral blue dress. i am a size 8-10 and ordered the medium. it did not find that it was large on top as others had mention. i love the smoking but would also look great with a belt and boots. it makes a great all weather dress.	1
"Well, another major score with pilcro! these pants, in general, are my go-to pants--so i had high expectations when i bought them. (i have about every color in the hyphen cut--and always hope they make more pairs) and, what do you know, they've met--even exceeded these expectations! love the fit--true to size--even though i will order another smaller size when i get smaller! these are good enough to have that ""big pair"" and that ""oh, i feel svelte pair!"" the denim has just enough stretch a"	1
This print is so cool! the shirt is just a little loose so order your usual size and it will fit perfectly.	1
I purchased this in grey and wine and both are wonderful. the boiled wool is light but warm and not itchy. fits nicely through the bodice and flares out to create a nice shape. the pockets are terrific and lay nice and flat. i'm short but the petite was well above my knee. i could have worn petite small just fine. it fit nicely in the bodice - the smaller size brought the seaming up a bit higher to form a more empire waist, but i chose the petite medium because i wanted it loose through the wais	1
I l o v e this sleeveless blouse for is soft tranquil print, wearability from day to night, comfort and fit! the design is flirty yet sophisticated-i wear it with skirts for work and jeans by night. can't say enough good things! everyone should have this beautiful piece in their wardrobe!	1
I bought this dress as a surprise for my daughter. she was very happy with it.	1
Super comfy skirt!  can't wait to wear it to football games this season!	1
I only tried on the ivory one, but it was so see-through, there was just no way. i can't speak for the other colors. seemed true to size, maybe a little large, but that's the style. very cute design, loved the back. too bad.	0
This shirt is so comfortable and soft. it has a great fit. it is a little thin, but i can get away with wearing it by itself. i love it!	1
Great material, and i like the idea of a scoop / v neck combination. but the hem rolls up, making it impossible to wear not tucked in to pants or a skirt (and even there it's a little bulky). it's possible that ordering a size up would fix the problem.	0
I saw this in the store a few weeks back and desperately wanted it. when it wet on sale, i grabbed it! i normally wear an xs or petite s, but with this one, the petite m was the winner! i am chesty and the top would not have zipped up had i gone any smaller. it is a bit wide on the bottom, and i agree with the reviewer who said it should be a bit more tailored on the bottom. still, with some awesome heels, this is a great summer piece! the lining is great quality. love it!	1
I'm. 5'2 and based on other reviewer's input, i went with a regular rather than petite and the length works well. the top is cute, but it billows out around the waist which isn't apparent on the model. other reviews mentioned that so i bought it anyway with that information and it's fine if you expect that. i'm a 34dd and find it to be a bit tight in the bust.	1
These pants fit the bill! they're soft and very comfortable. easy to wear day and night. these are a little higher on the waist, which i love. purchased two pair! i purchased the regular and they come to my ankles.	1
I agree a few others, it may be a little bit boxy but i don't even care because it's so beautiful! definitely a top i'm going to love long after this floral craze the fashion world is in begins to fade.	1
I made a visit to the store specifically to try on this dress and it was a disappointment for me. i tried on size 6 regular (i'm 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips) and i could not zip the dress up half way. the zipper is on the side, but it's more to the back which i have to stretch my arms all the way back to reach it. it stopped at my waist and was too tight for me to zip up anymore. i tried on an 8 regular and the entire dress was huge. (i'm 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips). i like the regular size because the l	1
I love these pants. i have them in navy and carbon. the navy color seems to run bigger than the carbon. they are very loose like a boyfriend pant in navy. they loosen up as the day goes on as well. super comfy and great for running errands and taking my little one to the park. i can look cute and feel comfy and i can give my yoga pants a break.	1
I like the idea of this but had to return it. the fitted liner is attached at shoulders and awkward to get into. the shirt is too poofy. didn't flatter short and curvy.	0
Sunday in brooklyn has been killing it lately with their tops! i could not decide between this and another of theirs, but i am glad i chose this one. first, the design is great. very cunning style: the sleeve length matches the length of the top tier, which gives this top a very finished look. the color is a beautiful jewel-like raspberry red with a bluish undertone. and, the fabric is a nice washable poly. i wore my usual size xs at retailer.	1
I wish these fit more like joggers, but they are slightly poofier. with the big buttons, i felt a bit too clownish. however, it's a great statement piece if you're up for it. the quality is good and the fabric has a nice texture. i think the problem was that since linen doesn't drape and scrunch like less structured fabrics, so it holds more volume instead of loose, semi-flowy menswear look. i	1
Soft, elegant, beautiful and makes me feel special! what more could one ask for? fit is true to size and has various styling options. best retailer purchase in some time.	1
This is a great cardigan to wear buttoned or open. the fit is perfect; it is fitted and looks great with jeans, skirts or over a sleeveless dress. love the little detail of lace to show skin. fabric has lycra so it hugs your bodice just enough!! love it.	1
I have these in 3 colors and i always wear a 27 in pilcro. i could probably size down but i like them a little loose. they are great to have in the spring and summer. they are very soft and very comfy.	1
"I have never purchased this brand before at retailer and there were no reviews on it when i purchased it.  i bought my usual size medium and it fit perfectly!  i am 5'2"", 120# with broad shoulders.  loved the fringe on the top and i think it will be very versatile . . .jeans/boots, skirts/heels.   definitely a keeper!  as a petite gal, this was not overly long.  if you have larger hips, this will not hang well."	1
This is an adorable dress. medium weight. i highly recommend.	1
Great quality and extremely flattering. bonus that it is on sale. i felt like this dress was a godsend. i am five months pregnant and needed a dress that made me feel comfortable but not frumpy. i think i'll get a lot of mileage out of it, as there's enough stretch to get me through the next few months and then (hopefully!) i can wear it after too. also can be dressed up or down, so appropriate for many occasions. i believe it runs true to size (i sized up, from xs to s, for obvious reasons, but	1
I purchased this top in both colors while on sale. it fits true to size. the material is heavier than i expected, but that just means it should hold up for a long time. recommend	1
It looks adorable in the picture... but just not flattering in real life. too much fabric in the skirt that flares from the waist in a bunchy, unflattering way. makes a slender but curvy figure look boxy, rather than enhancing curves. it's a pass. love the blue print, though.	0
This is my 4th pair of these printed cords and they are beautiful- the color says navy but these are definitely black with a grayish print. very stretchy all over except for the waist band which is a little uncomfortable but it might loosen up some. i wish the rise on these was a little higher. also worth noting is that the design on larger sizes won't look exactly like the picture- my size 33's have the floral scroll print up the front and the back, but also the cut has the scroll print running	1
Comfortable, cool-perfect summer tank. ordered  one for my daughter(small), had to get myself one too(medium)-both tts. great for errand runs, around house, lounging, sleeping. seems better made than more expensive tops ordered as of late. good job retailer	1
I love the pattern adn color combo, but, wow,t really flatering on me. too much fabric. i felt like i was trying to hide wight gain or pregnancy or wearing a mumu. anyway, not for me, but others might toll wnat to try in case it was just me... too bad. length was decent in regulat size though, not too long. just too wide.	0
Very soft and comfortable, great for girls who don't usually like shorts because of bigger/muscular thighs. i would say these run large, but not drastically. for reference, i'm usually a size 6 on the bottom and i got a small. the girl at the checkout counter called them pajama shorts but i think these can definitely be worn out of the house.	1
As a busty but small-waisted girl, i normally would not wear a loose shift like this. however, it turned out to be perfect for hiding my early/mid pregnancy belly. the dress is extremely comfortable, and it will also come in handy in the postpartum months. in fact, it looks so cute that i might just add it to my regular wardrobe after all.	1
Echoing others' remarks, this top runs large/wide (wise to size down). the embroidery is beautiful and for the volume of work, this arrived with minimal to no loose threads. however, i was bit disappointed by the mixed cotton textures - most of the top is a knit, tshirt like textures, while the bottom hem (with the horizontal stripe embroidery) is a stiffer, thinner woven cotton that i had thought would be the material for the whole shirt. the mixtures of textures and predominant knit textile ma	1
As a texas girl growing up with cheap hand embroidered tops from mexico - this is a treat and takes that style to a new level. quality fabric and workmanship in a unique sleeveless design! perfection.	1
I have these pants in navy and they're amazing! i cuff the hem in half and they look like joggers. they're ridiculously comfortable and tts but are not very thick so i'm pretty sure ivory would be see through; especially if you wear them during practice.	1
Likes: colors, the design of the flower is very pretty, the color-blocking is a nice touch and in this season, but, it is pretty short. i bought thh petite right off the bat as i assumed i would need that, but i really dind't. it ended up beign too short. #/4 sleeves always flattering, but hte cut is meant to be comfy, i think it would have looked better on me if it was a little more hourglass hsaped (if that makes sense#. i am usually xs, and that was fine, so buy your usual size ok #one siz	1
I love this dress. i think the cut, fabric and embroidery are all flattering. this dress is comfortable and can be dressed up or down. i am 5'1 and weigh anywhere from 108-113 lbs. i at first tried on the xxs petite and liked the look but found it to be tight in the arm area. they didn't have an xs petite so i tried on the s petite to see if there was any major difference. there totally was! so i ordered the xs petite online and can't wait to get it!!	1
I found the material a little stiff, im asummig linen is stiff at first. i got an xxs and fit tts in my case (34 b, 5'7, 120 lb).	1
I'm normally an xl, but i bought a l since so many said it was big and boxy. the l fit great. it's tailored to the body, but not tight-fitting, just as shown on the model. the detailing at the shoulders is heavy, compared to the light knit of the fabric of this tee. so, it pulls the neckline forward a bit.  i bought the red and wow! it's a bright, fireengine red that's just stunning. it looks lighter in the photo. it arrived all squished up in a little tiny roll so it was really wrinkled.	1
I bought this top in the stripe and i'm ordering the black now. it's a nice top to transition from summer to fall (even though the temp. doesn't change much in texas...#. it does run a bit large so size down. held up nicely when washed #hand wash cycle).	1
This is a beautiful sweater. high quality cashmere was used as it is very soft. as other reviewers stated, the sweater does run large. so i purchased one size down and ordered an xxs, for a perfect fit. i went with yellow, which is a great color. this is not high low, which i love! i am so thrilled, that just as soon as i'm finished writing this review, i'm going to purchase another sweater in red.	1
This top is perfect for a weekend casual look. you will love this, it fits true to size.	1
"This jumpsuit is absolutely beautiful. it fit like a glove and made me feel incredibly classy and sexy at the same time. i am 5'4"" and ~120lbs and the 4 fit like a glove and right at my ankles and above my elbows, the 6 fit a bit more loose and below my ankles and right at my elbows. it is so different and easy to wear."	1
Better than a regular boring cardigan. goes with short sleeves and dresses!!	1
I absolutely adore this skirt! sadly it was a lot of skirt for me- i'm 5 feet nothing and it would have been too much fabric to hem. wish this skirt came in a petite size. great color and a fun option for the fall wedding season!	1
This is soo cute and definitely runs tts. i ordered both the 6 and the 8 and ended up keeping the 8. i absolutley love this and i think it is unique and fun! i plan to wear it on a vacation in a month.	1
Love this ripple-front top. fabric is beautiful, love the lining and the fit is perfect. looks great with pants and skirts. i also love the sleeve length. i purchased this in both white and black. great for spring and summer.	1
Ordered a few things for a last minute decision on what to wear to a wedding - i slipped this on right out of the box and decision was made! tunic style is great for all body types and hides any bulges. crochet neckline and sleeves are cute and a little sexy. dress is very comfortable and not too short. wore this with pearls and ankle-strap pumps for a dressier look. very happy with this one!	1
I'm about 10-15 lbs overweight and the material clings a bit. this would be a wonderful top for someone who has a nice shape.	1
Runs big so size down. i love this top for many reasons but armholes are big so went to xs and i am usually a small or medium. xs was perfect and still long enough for me. gorgeous fabric and color and flow. got tons of compliments! very feminine and comfy. looks great with jeans and white crops.	1
I love that this top is double layered so it prevents any sheerness. the cream colored trim on the white top is really pretty- great combo. has a shabby chic feel. the fit is nice through the shoulders and eases up through the body - not fitted which i like.	1
I wear a lot of solid dark colors for work so i liked this was dark blue but had more pop than the basic navy. able to pay it up with other colors too. the sides are a little shorter so have to watch throughout the day so belly isn't showing. not a bid deal overall.	1
I loved the design and light weight quality. reference i'm 5'4, 125..i ordered a small, it's a tad big but i can handle it. because of the neck line, you must wear a strapless bra.	1
I've already worn this dress 4 times and i bought 3 weeks ago. easy to wear, comfortable and flattering. i love and wish it was available it more patterns.	1
"I got this in the floral print before it sold out, and i have never received so many compliments on a dress! it hangs so nicely and is so flattering. the neckline doesn't bother me at all (i know some reviewers mentioned that), but i am a very small busted woman so maybe it has something to do with that? i find it super comfortable, like wearing a nightgown. i am so in love with this dress i just ordered it again in black. it will be a summer staple. i found it runs true to size (i'm 5'3"", 115 p"	1
These are a comfortable, flattering casual pant. i usually wear a 27 in skinny jeans, so i dropped down to a 26 to make sure they weren't to baggy. i love them and will wear the a lot!	1
I purchased this shirt in black. luckily, it was on sell. it can be dressed up or dressed down. it's so easy to just throw this on with skinny pants or jeans. i got it on sale too. i just hope that i can keep it for years since it will always be in style.	1
Huge with bountiful amounts of extra fullness....not like represented picture. and it snags very easily. i have a 4 mo. old puppy that jumped up on me as i was trying it on and snagged it in several places. 'i'm going to see about returning it with the snags.	0
Wearing these for the first time today. the way the pants are made is the way a pair of quality pants should be. the fabric is gorgeous; the fit is excellent. the tone on tone flower is subtle but visible and creates a lovely pattern. the denim treatment at the ankle and waistband is a nice added touch. true to size, too. these are not your run of the mill above the ankle pants - they're something special and worth the money...the fact that i did get them on sale makes it an even better purchase	1
Great fit and very cute design. goes great with jeans.	1
I bought the white and olive today. i usually get a size s, but opted for the xs for this shirt. i am longer torsoed than perhaps average, so it came to just below mid-butt, which i like. my shoulders are on the broader side and a bit muscular, but even still the xs was perfect and cute, rather than just comfy. def an undershirt is needed for these, but i run cold, so i nearly always have an undershirt. the fabric is just nice enough that i could wear the shirt with a fun, nice skirt with a high	1
"The ""movement"" in these culottes when i walk makes me feel like i should have some, ""yeah, i can wear these attitude!"" not only is the quality exceptional but the fabric is ""thick"" enough to hide flaws. i am 5' 120 lbs and i ordered the 4petite. i am usually a 6petite. the size 4p fits perfectly. i ordered the apricot color. great neutral. i'm so happy i was able to get a pair -there's a reason most sizes are sold out! i have short legs, and my legs are medium in size. i worried about the thigh"	1
I love that his blazer is soft and not so structured. so great for a business casual environment. the gray goes with everything and is already a staple in my wardrobe.	1
I normally am a xl or size 18 in fabric tops (if they're not knit and do not stretch.) but, this looked to be a bit boxy and so i bought the 16 and it fit fine. it fit like on the model....tailored, but loose and not really a lot of fabric or boxy. now, the fabric is stiff. and, it's sheer. but, the pockets land where your breasts are. so, i wore this with a nude bra and it's just like in the photo. there are peeks but you don't see anything. however, if this is for work, i'd put a cami under	1
I am quite happy with this dress! i was wondering what the colors would look like in person, and i'm happy to report that the skirt is a nice mellow orange-coral. beautiful detail in the patterns used here, and i always like a dress that has great color-play close up and far away. for reference, i am a size 16, full figured, with a 40 c bust, and the size 16 was just right for me. sometimes with maeve dresses you can size down, but there is no stretch to the dress, or the slip, so that is someth	1
Runs big and looked unflattering. i am petite, might work on someone taller.	0
I must be the lone dissenter, but i am in love with this piece! a dark cami underneath really make the eyelet pop. i probably would not have liked it if it did not have the clasp, as it does run wide. however, with skinny jeans or slim pants, this works b/c it's loose in the right ways. it may not be for everyone, but it's one of my faves right now.	1
"I'm obsessed with this dress.  it's so pretty and love that it has a lining.  i'm 5'1"" and got a small, i had dry cleaner take it in from the sides so i didn't look swallowed up in dress and now it's perfect.  still has the swing but not as bulky.   can't wait to wear it out!"	1
Love the colors and top part but it runs extremely large and there is way too much fabric it is almost like a moo moo. had to return	1
Pants were super comfortable. a little too large. and the fabric was a little too heavy. i sent them back, and i'm regretting it now that they're completely unavailable.	1
Hi there,  if you are looking for a shirt you can wear all summer long; this is it! soft, a little darker than shown in the picture (which i like better), and super comfortable. it also keeps me cool in these hot june temperatures. a great blouse to throw on with shorts or white jeans, and it can easily be dressed up for casual fridays at work. it is definitely oversized, but no more so than all clothes these days. i stuck with a size small and usually wear a size 4/6 in tops. so, if you are ti	1
I absolutely love these shorts. i ordered a medium. i was nervous they would be too small, (my legs aren't the skinniest), but because of the slit on the side, they were fine. i do have a pretty tiny waist, and they were slightly snug but not too much to send them back. i am almost 5'7' and weight 145. i have a solid black one piece suit and they look great with it. i love the material as well, they are extremely comfortable. a little pricey, but i will definitely make use of them. i love the pr	1
I ordered these in the neutral and the fabric and construction are everything i hoped they would be. they are a lovely light weight rayon that i think will be very comfortable in hot weather. the printed fabric is really pretty. sadly, they seem to run on the large size. i wear size 14 pants, but the xl was too baggy in the legs and a little too large in the waist. i am sending them back and getting the smaller size.	1
Loved it. i have receive so many compliments when i wear this. it fit great.	1
Weighs nothing. so comfortable. great length, not too short. fits a tad loose, but very pretty and easy to wear. fun print, flattering, casual style with a touch of class. 5'3 110lbs and the xs fits just as it shows on the model.	1
I bought this in june on a sale and am so glad that i did. it''s so pretty and classy. the neck has stretch so it's not tight at all. it's styled like a swing top, but it really isn't. there isn't much of a fabric abundance to this, although it is loose (and cool.) i bought an xl, which is my usual size and the fit is fine. there are 2 layers of fabric. i do not think a cami is needed at all. i bought this in black and the floral embroidery just pops! i'm just not a white fan due to cleani	1
I bought this online days before my trip to seattle. i read the reviews so was aware it runs large...and it does. i practically lived in it the whole time i was there. it's very comfortable and once it cools down here in so cal i'll be back in it. some reviewers mentioned it bunched up when tied but didn't like the ties hanging loose. i just looped each one and it works great.  it really runs large. i bought their smallest size and had ample room.	1
I'm in love with this print! the fabric feels wonderful- this is such a perfect transition dress! the adjustable waist tie makes the dress fit great!	1
Bought one for myself and one for my mom.  we both love it.  super soft. boxy and oversized but great for layering over a belted tunic.	1
This dress is nicely made and hangs beautifully. i did find the shoulders a bit too wide even though i have pretty broad shoulders. then again, i'm also pretty tall and the length on this dress is really nice, so i'll take the slightly wide shoulders. the low back and gathered waist are very flattering. a perfect dress to wear in the summer!	1
I love this dress! would like to see one.september make it in sky like their meda lace top. runs a little big. i normally wear a l but the m fit perfectly.	1
This dress is awesome - i actually first saw it on lucy lui on elementary and thought it had to be from retailer. sure enough it was and it was on sale. i got the blue and would have gotten both if they had my size. i am usually a m and found this fit true to size. i always love a wrap dress and this with the buttons keeps it from spilling open - love it!	1
"I love the color and design of this suit, however, the rise is too high on my derriã¨re and was not appealing on myself! i am 5'7"" 110 lbs., with a very small bust and a short waist. i think the suit runs very small, as i am a size xs/s in most of retailers clothing. i would recommend it to young lady with a very small derriere and is more petite!"	1
This dress is really cute, it's not a complete bag on you. i read that other reviewers complained about the fact that it is see-through. and that is the case, but i own multiple pairs of skin-toned underwear and did not find this to be a problem. the fabric is lightweight, but perfect for the summer. it does wrinkle, but a steamer is your best friend.	1
Love! i wish this came in additional motifs! hits at hip, i have a long torso, perfect for high rise skinny jeans and sandals.	1
I really love this shirt for its versatility. it looks casual with jeans and dressy with a skirt, or even jeans and heels. the shirt itself is super soft. it's boxier than it looks in the picture, but not to the point of crop-top. the shirt still hits at my hips.	1
I took advantage of the promotional discount offered on this coat. i admired this soon as it appeared.  hesitant to purchase without any reviews, nor had opportunity to visit the store so i took a chance.  i love the pattern, burgundy wine faux fur collar, the fit. colors are true. i sized up which i recommend. glad i did, this will require thick sweater to provide any type of warmth if you are in a colder climate.  length mid-knee. imo not worth full price.  eleveness does design pretty coats!	1
I just adore these shorts from art dept. they are casual, yet slightly structured. the length is just perfect (for me), no ride up, no wrinkles (i can't stand wrinkled shorts), and the fringe gives these shorts a fun and playful look just perfect for a stroll on the beach or shopping with your girlfriends. i know these shorts are going to be a staple in my summer wardrobe for years. can i have these in more colors and patterns too????	1
I bought the top that goes with the pants & live that it's comfortable to wear at home yet looks good enough to to go anywhere. easy to care for. very happy with this!!	1
I found this pretty sweater to run true to size. i am between a size large and extra large and the large fit well. it is perfect in the shoulders and body skimming without being too flared at the hem. the lavender is a dreamy light sky blue, true to what my monitor shows. i rarely wear anything but black and gray, but i could not resist this color. the sweater is a medium weight and i anticipate wearing this at the beach with white jeans and now with pale gray narrow wool pants. i really like th	1
I just received this and wore it immediately - it is cute even under a cardigan because the pattern 'peeks' out, giving some depth to an otherwise plain white shirt. the material is soft and sort of on the thin side but not see-through. it is a fine knit, and has a satin-like thread to it which makes it soft and cool - perfect for a summer day! it is not as slim on me as the model but i am very petite (51 100 lb) and i think this would run closer to tts.	1
Fun , flirty, feminine!! love this blouse with jeans or with a skirt or leggings! i bought both blues i liked the first and after wearing it i ordered the navy with dots along with santuary black legging pants... just love !!!highly recommend. easy to wear.	1
I wanted to buy my usual mp but was sold out and so was normal m. i got the regular l and it fits like a shift dress and does not enhance my curves. it looks like a luxurious knitted sack but i mean that in a good way. it is very comfortable, does not cling, and reaches just below my knees. i do worry about the stretch factor as other reviewers have noted but since i just received it we will see. i do not like the sheer sleeves. i wish i could take them off. i do not like the button loop at the	1
"This is a great dress - nice soft fabric and the red is a nice, vibrant tomato red color.  i ordered a small - i am 5'4"" and usually wear a 4 in dressed.  this dress was so huge - it might be mismarked but labeled a small.  i will have to return it - not even my seamstress can make it fit!"	1
This tank is so light and made with great fabric. i bought this to wear over pants - black jeans, classic denim, this fall, maybe with a jacket over.  i purchased a size medium, and it is loose and comfortable.	1
Love this tank. it is so soft and comfortable. the length hits just right on the hip. it hugs the body nicely, not too tight, just loose enough on a hot summer day. i have this in black and white. i wish they would offer more colors.	1
Soft and flowy and perfect for those in-between seasons.	1
Love these leggings & the color. i haven't been able to find a pair of great brown leggings for years. i was concerned the small might not fit but they are perfect	1
"I have a small collection of retailer pants for work, and this pair fit neatly into a hole-- i don't have a fun, patterned pair. i am short (5'2"") and definitely needed a petite to get the crop to land in the right spot. my usual 0p fit perfectly up above. the flare seems a bit more pronounced on me than in the picture. the fabric is nice quality, smooth and medium weight with a bit of stretch, and i like the fact that these are machine washable. this gal has other things to do with her life besid"	1
First off, the other reviews are spot on regarding the quality of this top. the material is thick and pleasant feeling, the print is beautiful and the construction is nicely done. however, i just couldn't get past the fit issue, which was also mentioned by the other reviewers. i ordered a 14 for my 38 dd chest, and it was loose in all the wrong places. i'd be interested to see what a 12 looks like on me, but i'm afraid it would be too snug. this may look awesome on someone else, but i had to ret	1
"I saw this online and said to myself, next time you are in the retailer store look for this dress. i am glad i did! i bought the neutral dress (off white,tan.black) because i knew it would go with everything and most occasions. i am 5'6"", 136 pounds, the small fit me perfect! in retailer dresses i am between a small/med. the top of the dress is lined and form fitting which is a plus. the off white coored section does go across the chest so one must wear a neutral colored lined bra even though the to"	1
This dress is very flattering and tts. i bought this dress for my brother's wedding at the end of june. i love that it is machine washable, which was the reason i chose this dress instead of another. as another reviewer already mentioned, it is brighter than photographed.	1
I really wanted this skirt to work but it didn't look very flattering on me. a great midi length and very cool pattern, so hopefully will work for others!	0
These are the most comfortable pants i own. i bought them in the gold, green, and gray (which really does look more like a grayish purple). the gold is my favorite - it goes with so many things! i was just checking to see if there were any other colors - would love them in black and a burgundy. i'm about 125 lbs,, 5 foot 7, and the 28 is a perfect fit. the saleswoman warned that they would stretch out, but i haven't found that to be a real problem.	1
"I saw this top online and loved it. i wasn't sure about sizing and because i don't live near a store i decided to order two sizes. i'm 5'8"" and typically wear an 8 or medium in tops. the 8 in this top though was much too tight in the shoulders. i sized up to a 10 and it fit beautifully!"	1
Very flattering suit. embroidery is unique and the cut flatters.	1
I love this dress and received many compliments when i wore it. the pink is beautiful. however, it does run large so i will need to exchange it. the little square at the base of the neckline was crooked on the one i received. might not bug anyone else, but it bothered me.	1
I absolutely love the retro look of this swimsuit. i first saw it on blogger amber fillerup-clark (barefoot blonde) and i knew i had to have it. this is the first one piece suit i've purchased in about six years. i've avoided one pieces because most of the ones i tried made me feel frumpy, and the mono-kini look just looked odd on me. i have a smaller frame and a larger bust (32ddd), so finding swimsuits that fit properly is a challenge. i am a size 4 but i ordered a size 6 after reading reviews	1
Versatile and flattering. i don't order many clothes online because i'm a tough fit and need to try on first, but this was one of the rare times it was worth the risk. i love the high waisted, vintage style and the length is perfect. the bold color is fun. the little details are even better- navy blue piping, the buttons and the ribbon laced on the back. great skirt.	1
"Bought this for my daughter who is graduating this year. looks much better in person then it does in the photo. she is 5'7"" and 135lb. we bought the size four. great length on her. green adds a nice pop of color. she loves it."	1
I ordered this dress in my usual size and unfortunately when it arrived, it was damaged and also a little too big. the fabric had lots of pulls in it like it had been tried on many times. i called customer service and requested a replacement in a smaller size. it fit great and looked beautiful but there was a rip in the sleeve. this is a gorgeous dress and very flattering and well fitting (if you size down), but i had to return both and wear something else to a holiday party. i'd only recomme	0
This is a very sexy suit. it took some time to figure out how to put it on. it needs instructions, but it is well worth it.	1
"I found this dress to run large (like the other reviewers have mentioned). the quality is really nice, and the sweater fabric is a nice touch. it hit me right above the knee, and i an 5'5"". it is a purplish pink (as pictured). if it fits you properly, you will be pleased with the quality, color and unique style."	0
"I ordered the floral version of this swimsuit - what you can't really tell from the images is the darling, lavender stripe design that is in set opposite the floral. it's truly a darling suit, and very well made. the fit is very flattering, with oddly enough a conservative yet sexy appeal. i ordered a medium after reading the ""size up"" recommendations from other consumers - but, i've exchanged it for a small. the cup size was over-exaggerated in the medium - and, i had plenty of breathing room i"	1
Bought this blouse to wear with high wasted jeans and pants. it lays beautifully and can be dressed up or down. it's somewhat sheer, but i don't plan on wearing a cami under it. perfect for work or going out.	1
I am not a big fan of lace but this shirt has just enough. it actually looks better than the photo and it looks even better when you wear it. i have received numerous compliments on this shirt everytime i've worn it.	1
"This dress is pretty and is somewhat fitted in the bodice. it does have an a-line fit in the skirt. the stitching is beautiful. honestly the stitching was a little too bright for me. some may like that, but i was hoping for a little more toned down or muted. the colors are so vibrant in my opinion it almost cheapens the dress. the fabric is cotton and it is not lined. i am 5'9"" and it does hit right about where it does on the model. i am sending it back, because i didn't say ""wow, i love this"" w"	1
This dress looks amazing on-line. in person the arm ruffles are much larger and stick out, and the dress at the bottom makes you look like strawberry shortcake. too much all over ruffling at the chest and is not flattering. pattern is dizzying in person.  very thin multi layer dress. should be better material and quality for this price. save your money and shipping.	0
So incredibly comfortable.  the sweater wasn't flattering on me (i'm super busty) so i sent it back but it was a tough call because of how incredibly soft.	1
I was attracted to the colors when i first saw it...then i saw the back of it! the largest sz in the store was an 8.i had to order it, and got a sz 10. i then returned it for a 12 in order for it to drape properly in front. shorter than i usually wear, but worn with a higher waist bottom it fits nicely. and that back! not only is is striking, i am able to wear my regular bra under it, and the straps don't hang out.	1
"I purchased this and another eva franco dress during retailer's recent 20% off sale. i was looking for dresses that were work appropriate, but that would also transition well to happy hour or date night. they both seemed to be just what i was looking for. i ordered a 4 regular and a 6 regular, as i am usually in between sizes. the 4 was definitely too small. the 6 fit, technically, but was very ill fitting. not only is the dress itself short, but it is very short-waisted. i am only 5'3"", but it fe"	0
Beautiful, flattering dress. love that you can where a bra without having to be concerned about straps showing. very happy with purchase. highly recommend.	1
I love cashmere, love the length, cowl-neck and colors, however i found the yellow to be bit more vibrant in person, which i liked. i'm not sure i will keep this because it seemed to be a bit too thin for my taste. i would gladly pay a bit more for a thicker ply sweater... i might justify this one at a sale price.	0
I have been eyeballing this shirt online. during my visit yesterday an associate just happened to bring one out for me to try on as my store had just gotten it in. happy coincidence!  the fabric is very soft and comfortable with some give/stretch. the sleeves seem sturdy like they will hold up in the wash. i thought the shoulder area was fitted but not too snug, however i have smallish shoulders. the v neck wasn't too low (no cami needed) but low enough to be a little sexy/not dowdy. it's fai	1
Super soft and stylish. it's a major step up from my overly casual fleece jackets. love it. i think the sizing is dead on so i would disagree with a review that it runs small. i'm 5'10 and 142lbs. typically wear a size s, but sometimes have to size up to a m. i got a s. fits great. not too tight. sleeves are plenty long enough. i typically wear this with skinny jeans to work (aka grad school), and i like that it functions as a jacket on chilly mornings, but its not too bulky so i can keep it on	1
This top is very pretty, i ordered both xs p and xxs p not knowing (someone wrote the word boxy in the review) - i tried on the xxs p first, and that was fine. did the trick to not look too boxy. teh fabric is stretchy, and soft/comfortable, not scratchy lace. the lining is soft as well. color is ivory and the embroidery is nice and fiery colors. the sleeves are fairly flattering, even on bigger arms. arm hole was just right too, never know with fluttery sleeves.  for reference i am 115 lbs, 30	1
I tried this in the fish print and the pallas stripe. i did not like the fit of the fish print, but the stripe is perfect--so try more than one color if you are interested in this style. also try more than one size of course. i almost always order up in a swimsuit, and this time was no different. the medium fit great, although i am a xs-s according to the size guide. i am a 34b for reference, but i think my rib cage is somewhat wide. i do not like to feel constricted, but i still want the top to	1
Mes demosilles style incorporates lots of material. this cotton layered, voluminous dress is an eye catcher but not for all figures. i like this bohemian style because it is different and can be worn with a belt to show off more of your figure or loose fitting.  i ordered a 36 size which fitted perfectly around the bust but i have broad shoulders and there is no zipper. i had to purchase the 38 size so i could remove the dress over my shoulders without too much trouble.	1
This dress is gorgeous. it is better in person than online. i love the detail of the pleats and the waist. it is light weight and perfectly lines and a beautiful dress for twirling with a martini in hand. in fact, my sister tried to steal it from during a recent trip to europe. it is that adorable and flattering - highly recommend!	1
I loved this on the cover of the august catalog. when i saw the pictures online, i was a bit hesitant because the background of the dress looked white, and i wondered whether it would be too washed out for me. not so. i love it! it fits beautifully; the waistline is very flattering. it looks like a dress a model would wear in the 1960s -- not a hippie, but a model in a high fashion magazine. it looks great with boots. the fabric is soft to the touch, so luxurious. i am of polish and lithuanian d	1
I adore this dress. it has a fairly thick material, which helps the skirt stay full and is very flattering if, like me, your thighs or tummy can be a problem area in dresses! the only downside for me is the fact that i have fairly narrow shoulders, so the seam for the sleeves tends to stick out a bit! i get lots of compliments on this one!	1
This dress is easy and attractive. it's very soft and just slips on, but looks very put together. on my shorter frame, it's a bit long, more midi length, but it's so comfortable and pretty, that i'm fine with it; it looks a little bit 20's that way. recommended.	1
A beautiful silk dress - light and cute but not worth the price. this dress is extremely thin and no lined at all. it's very light and i'm afraid would be completely see through.	0
This dress is a lovely fit. the knit top accentuates the bust and the loose skirt below the empire waist just skims the figure. it's pretty casual and the skirt is a tiny bit sheer so better for weekends than for office wear.	1
Everybody else is correct. the dress is adorable but the fit is weird. i am usually a size 2 (134lb, 34 c) but got the 4 based on the reviews. the waist fits perfect, the top is huge, especially the armholes. if i get a size 2 then the waist will be too tight. however, the dress is so cute i am considering taking it for alterations and keeping it. definitely it has fit issues.	1
I really loved the material and the feel of this item, however it does run very large. even though it is meant to be loungewear it is great as a top with skinny jeans or leggings.	1
Beautiful! caught my eye online. i had to order then reorder in a smaller size, but it is wonderful. colors are beautiful.	1
This cover-up is perfect for the beach or the pool. it is see through.	1
I buy almost ever top tiny puts out and so i grabbed this one in the last tops sale since i'm a sucker for embroidered flowers. everything about it is gorgeous except it is so flimsy i can't even believe it. like when i held it up in the dressing room, i could see through the entire shirt, front to back, before even putting it on. once on, i could see everything through it. i actually thought i was going to tear the thing to pieces trying it on, it's so frail. i own so many tiny shirts and while	0
"I just wore this dress tonight to my holiday party and received many compliments on it. it's so comfortable and even though the fabric is thick, it's not bulky or stiff like some embroidered fabric can be. and the side pockets make a great addition too. unlike other reviews, i thought the armholes were perfect. the cutout in the back is a nice touch, and i was able to wear a regular bra with it. the colors are beautiful and true to the pic, i was not surprised by the ""brightness"" of it like othe"	1
Absolutely love this top. it is beautiful, well made and so unique.	1
The fabric is very comfortable and soft. love it - great fit.(tts) would recommend	1
Gorgeous dress worth every penny--one of a kind twist on a kimono!	1
I bought these to wear to a christmas party with a lacy blouse, but found they were what's been missing in my life. after wearing them nearly every other day, i decided i needed another pair. feel like yoga pants but look polished. make your butt look perky and your legs slim. .... maybe i need another pair!	1
This dress caught my eye online and i had to have it. when it arrived it was still just as pretty as i remembered. beautiful, vibrant colors and a unique oversized floral on a flirty, swishy fabric. unfortunately the cut was really strange. after reading several reviews i went with an xs, but i'm not sure a s would have solved all the fit problems i was having. while everything from the waist down fit perfectly, the arms were cut too tight, the chest was huge and yet i struggled to zip it up. an	1
"Super long even at 5'7"" and a little too voluminous for my taste. incredibly comfortable and beautiful pattern though. i'm having a hard time imagining there getting much use for me, so even at the sale price they're going back."	1
"I am very particular about jeans. it's not just the look; it;s the feel and the quality of the fabric that won me over. the mid-rise wide-leg crop is perfection. i'm 5'7"" and a size 8. these are extremely flattering and versatile to go casual or incorporate into a more professional feel. great way to show off some of the fabulous fall footwear options as well. i highly recommend."	1
I never would have thought that i could wear a jumpsuit and it actually look good on me, but this is it!!! the fabric is weighted some so it lays very flattering and is very comfortable. the sash can be tied several ways-front, back, or side. i will be traveling in this to the beach and pairing it with an retailer wrap, and then wearing it alone with sandals once we exit the freezing airplanes. a racer back bra works great with this piece and the pockets are an added bonus. it looks like a d	1
I love this dress. i would have never picked it off the hanger in the store, in fact i went right past it. however, when i was in the dressing room trying something else on i saw two girls wearing it and it was adorable. i immediately tried it on and loved it. i think it runs really big. i am normally a size 8/athletic build and i bought the x-small. i small also fit but was a bit too baggy. most tops/dresses at retailer also run big so it makes sense this does too but there is no way i am a true	1
Lovely drape and design. true to size. more of a muted crimson/brick color.	1
This shirt can look very elegant thanks to the nice duffs and hidden button line. the material is pleasantly substancial and very soft. the only thing i did not like is that the bottom button broke it two pieces the tirst tme i buttoned it. no spare buttons included, but as the buttons are not visible i think i can find a similar one to replace it. not big enough of an issue to return,	1
These leggings are very comfortable and cute. only reason they are not 5 stars is because the pattern is not quite as vibrant as i was expecting.	1
"Nice thin tank. back half is a jersey knit (different fabric than the front). good layering piece. at 5'4"" 140 lbs, the medium is a nice length, reaching my hip flexors in front ...although, i'm rather short waisted..."	1
I found the fit of this dress odd. i typically wear a 6 or 8 in dresses. the 6 fit across the chest but the armholes were large so wearing a bra would be a challenge. i am a 34c so i need some type of support. i also thought the fabric was a bit flimsy for the price. i am a huge retailer fan and usually leave glowing reviews but sadly i left this one in the store.	0
Love this dress! the material has a softness to it - just love it! can't wait to wear it this summer. fits true to size.	1
"I purchased this swimsuit in the mint. gorgeous color combination. i'm 5'5"" and weigh 117 lbs. i purchased a small. the fit is true to size. i love the front design; however, my husband promptly brought the back of the swimsuit to my attention. the chevron was off center. the design should have been centered with my back; however, it was on the right side of my back. i immediately called retailer assuming the product was defective. the item was sold out on line; however, a supervisor was able to l"	0
I bought this shirt in the rust color along with the blue/black sweater skirt after seeing it on display in the store. not sure i would have ever put those 2 together but i love the outfit. i'm not much of a shirt-tucker, either, but this shirt works either way. tucked in a skirt or more casual with jeans. my only criticism is the static cling in the front, as mentioned by another reviewer. i had thought of getting it in white, but if it's shear, then maybe not. haven't been wearing a tank under	1
This skirt is going to be perfect for the hot texas summers. super lightweight and floaty, and the pattern is so gorgeous. will go great with my favorite purple shoes!	1
This was a nice surprise because it's a thick sweatshirt type of fabric. don't be deterred! it is nothing like a sweatshirt. it's comfy like a sweatshirt though. i'm 5 feet tall 120 pounds. i ordered my usual size petite small and it fit perfectly. what little height i have is in my torso. i didn't find that the top was short at all. it's without a doubt tts. order your usual size. if you have a tummy or bootie this top is the ticket! the description on the fabric details that the other reviews	1
I love this top! i'm 5'7'', 135 lb and the small fits well (probably could have fit in the xs). it is more fitted at the top and flowy at the bottom. i ordered it in orange and it is a very pretty peachy coral stripe. highly recommend for a comfy top that can be dressed up a bit more than your average t-shirt.	1
I don't know why this piece is so wide around the body. the fabric is very good. just the design is way boxy. i get xsp, still boxy.	0
This dress is beautiful--lovely colors and design--but it's huuuge. i'm usually a s/m in tops and dresses, but i got an xs after trying it on in the store. i'm busty and have hips and still have a bit of room. the length is good--a little above the knee but still work appropriate. with my curves it's not my most flattering dress since it pretty much falls straight down, but i think it's too pretty not to keep.	1
I like the make of this dress, the fabric is thick and light at the same time. the cut is loose and flattering. the different patterns are also very fun. colors are gorgeous, nice details. the buttons are sturdy.  i tried on both 0p and 00p - not much difference in the 2 (i would go petite if you are on the short side). the 00p was just a bit snugger near the =chest, but didn't gape. the waist is definitely meant to be looser, so don't expect a fitted dress. length was slightly above the knee	1
"A cute top. the peplum seam hits me at the right spot on my waist. for my curvy figure, this isn't always the case. i also am drawn to tanks that i can actually wear a bra underneath without showing bra straps. i usually vary between a medium and a large in deletta, but definitely needed a large. i ordered the ""lavender"" color, which is disappointing; a dull gray. i've decided to return and order the coral instead."	1
I had high hopes for this top, as it looked great online. unfortunately it was much more ruffly in person and not my style at all. it was a lot of fabric and poofed out too much -- reminded me of a child's top. sad to return it!	0
"Love this! ordered it on sale, but i really do think it's worth full price! i went with a small even though an extra small would have been good too...i'm slender and 5'9"" about 125# with full bust. the small fits similar to the model, and because i wanted it to fit well in the sleeves (i have long arms!) and length, i went with the small. maybe should have gone smaller as it is roomy! it's very well made and although you'll need a cami, i still feel as if it will be very cozy. perfect for our mi"	1
The sweater is light and very soft. the silver banding on the neck, sleeves and hem make it easy to dress up.	1
I wore this sweater last weekend and received so many compliments. not only is this a very pretty style, the poncho is comfortable. i really glad i purchased.	1
This is one of those dresses that might be better for those under 40. on me, the fullness of the pleats and the bell sleeve made me feel like i was wearing one of those dresses for a much older lady. i miss not having to consider those things. the red color is lovely and the dress is modest. i just think it will read a lot better on a younger chiquita.	1
I was excited to receive this top. it looked great online, vibrant colors with the beautiful detail on the sleeves. when i tried it on, the fabric looked and felt cheap. it is not a flowy top. do not recommend it.	0
I loved this when i got it. it has such a flattering fit! slightly loose in the body, but not flowy. nice weight of fabric. comfortable fabric. perfect scoop neck that doesn't show too much cleavage. but i washed it once on delicate and line dried (which i do with most of my shirts) and it came out riddled in holes.	0
130 lb, 5'5, 32dd. ordered xs. this dress is a bit outside my normal retailer style, but i love tracy reese designs and it had good reviews so i decided to give it a try. i could not be more pleased with this decision. as some of the other reviewers have said, the dress is very well made. the lining in particular is excellent- it is a soft mesh that prevents the dress from clinging, without adding bulk in the hot summer weather. i typically wear more structured dresses, but the lining on this dres	1
Very soft, cute design, great over leggings!	1
"This is a great bikini bottom. i purchased this along with the matching top, and you can definitely tell a difference in the quality of the material for these. the print is beautiful, and the cut is very flattering - my only ""issue"" is a matter of personal preference - these were much ""cheekier"" on me than the photo of the model (i have a larger behind). for reference, i am usually a 6/8 28/29 in bottoms, and purchased a medium. sizing up would have only presented an issue in the waist fitting."	1
Wanted to get this sweater in the red but the size has been sold out for a long time, then saw the navy go on sale and snatched it up. great fit, cropped shorter than most sweaters very classic looking and perfect for layering into the fall.	1
"I love the look of this dress & had high hopes, but it didn't live up to them. have no doubt that it is well made & beautiful, fully lined with lovely detailing around the neck. i am 5'6"", 155lbs with a postpartum belly that i'd like to hide, so i chose this dress as the reviews say it's a bit loose & forgiving. i found it to be so loose that it looks big & entirely hides my figure! i considered ordering a small, but knew that it was simply the cut of the dress & going down a size wouldn't chang"	0
This is a great dress for me to wear to work, lounging on a sunday and everywhere in-between. i'd even wear it over a bathing suite on a chilly beach. highly recommend it!	1
This is a very slimming, well-made, nice fitting top-i just disliked the colors. they did not look good on me. otherwise this is a very nice piece!	1
I like the red color and the border detail at the neckline. i'm not crazy about the way the zipper on the back is emphasized. i'd rather have a less visible zipper. overall it is a cute and comfortable dress. the fabric is soft and substantial and has a nice texture to it. the shape is basic so it can be dressed up or down.	1
This dress is beautiful on, is thin enough to be extremely comfortable. being curvy, it feels a little more narrow than i would prefer, but i kept it anyway because it is so beautiful as well as functional.	1
"Oh how i dread online shopping for bikinis...especially bottoms. however, these bottoms are incredible. the fit is perfect. you know when you are wearing normal underwear and you ask yourself... ""why can't bathing suit bottoms just fit like this?"" these bikini bottoms do! you can't tell by the picture but they are a really great weight...not too thick and bulky...very flattering...perfect rear coverage...doesn't pinch your sides.truly the most flattering bottoms i've found in a long time. worth"	1
I like this tunic. it is quite long and print in blue looks good with the butterflies. it feels very hot though! maybe better for winter. the sleeves are linen, i usually don't like linen much, it feels scratchy. this top works better in colder weather due to the sleeves and length of top. more like a tunic. i recommend it but am sending it back because i need something for summer.	1
Beautiful, well made and styled dress. perfect for company christmas parties where you want to look nice but not show too much cleavage. i wear it with a cameo brooch.	1
Too pricey for the quality of this imported product.	0
This dress would have been perfect in a medium petite. beautiful dress, wish i had sized down	1
This is a really great dress - especially for the holiday season - you can do work and post work events with it easily. i ordered a large but it fit me more like a medium. it is very comfortable and the quality feels great. boots give it the day look and a nice set of beige high heels gave it a great evening look.	1
These are cool jeans to have in a mound of typical denim jeans i have in my closet and these are like a thorwback of the 60s/70s made with modern, high quality denim. this is my first pair of 7 for all mankind denim, so i can't reference how they fit to their other jeans. however, based on typical pants sizing with other brands at retailer, these pants do run smaller than other brands, especially in the waist area. i ended up buying my size but clearly a diet will be in my near future because they	1
I love these jeans, but they run small. i recommend ordering one size up.	1
"I am currently searching for the perfect pair of white boots to go with this. this is so fun. i used to wear a lot of vintage clothes and this dress lit the fire again to start looking for cool pieces. i tried on my usual size and found that it fit pretty tts. it was a bit roomy in the hips, but considering the cut of the dress, i assume that to be intentional. for reference, i am 5'9"", 150 lbs, 36d and bought a size 8."	1
This is a great tee.... i bought this in the green in a size m. i'm normally a small but because of the fitted look, i opted for the medium. i probably could have sized down to the small, but the medium is still fitted just not too tight, which is actually a nice look. the only thing i wish was different are the sleeves. the sleeves are just a little too puffy for me, but it's so cute that i'm keeping it.	1
I bought this and like other reviews, agree that the quality probably could be better, but i still love it enough to keep. the buckle fell apart, but i was able to fix it and the zipper seems a little weak. it has pilled, but the fabric is textured, so i didn't even notice until i read the other reviews and then looked back at my jacket.  it is a perfect medium coat for 40's & 50's before i am ready to bust out my ugly down north face for winter.  i get compliments every time i wear it!  love!!	1
Soft and stylish - my usual large seems a bit too large, so i will try a medium.	1
I am very petite and ordered the xs. it is too big which is often the case. i gauge how much i like something by my willingness to spend even more money on alterations. i love this jacket so much that i am willing to go through that extra step. i love winter and this is a perfect winter top. the faux fur is very soft and cozy and has a rich look to it. i have yet to have it altered which is the only reason for my 4 stars under quality. i don't yet know how it will fit once complete. the fact tha	1
I was so impressed with the style & boning on the sides for the perfect fit! it's truly a classic staple in your closet for that lbd!!	1
I bought this top in taupe and love the style. it's not too boxy or long. cotton is always a plus and i just wish there were more colors.	1
The back of this top is nice but it is very flowy. i ordered a small (32dd, normally a 4/6 in retailer tops) -- a smaller size would fit better but is not available. overall nice, but wish it came in a smaller size.	1
Wear the collar down & it favors grace kelly. pull it up and it's an oversized hood. this lightweight cozy piece combines everything i love about a sweater & a coat in one.	1
"Just picked this up at a store....had a terrible time deciding between the plaid and the chambray but went with the chambray. super soft fabric and not too short for a 55 year old. i'm 5'5"", 135 lbs, and 34 d and the medium is perfect. sometimes i wear a small but have broad shoulders so need the m in this. i'll wear without a belt...it falls nicely and is very flattering!"	1
First of all, this dress is not cotton. it is 100% silk. it also not a pullover dress (it has a side zipper) and does not have an elastic waist like the description says. lastly, it is not by moulinette souers. i've really never seen a description so far off on one of the items pictured. nevertheless, it is a gorgeous dress. the silk is beautiful and can easily be worn for fall with a sweater or jacket. the waist is a little poofy and the chest is a bit snug. however, i was able to go down a siz	1
"This ""little"" dress is extremely cute and very comfortable. i didn't pay enough attention to the picture and totally missed the faux wrap skirt, but that only adds to the appeal, and is well done, not showing too much skin. this dress looks great with a white denim jacket or a red cardi. it will get lots of use and really is a 3 quarters of the year piece."	1
Let me start off by saying i never write reviews, but feel compelled to so that no one else gets swindled into buying this beautiful one-time wear piece. i absolutely fell in love with this shirt when i bought it in the fall in black... perfect basic to wear under my new draped open vest from retailer! and perfect fit! i'm long torso-ed and long armed and always have trouble with fit. this being kind of oversized was just loose enough and long enough i could actually feel comfortable wearing it wi	0
I love the length of the dress and the fun swing the skirt has. the print is wonderful.	1
"I am so happy i decided to try this on in store. it is absolutely stunning! unfortunately they only had a m and it was a little too flowy so have the s ordered and anxious to try it on. the top is really where i am concerned it is too large. i am 5'3"", 36dd and 130#, athletic build. since you really cannot wear a bra with it, which is okay btw, the armholes were a little too open and afraid things may show ;). the bottom fit okay, a little on the large side but this should fit loose and flowy. c"	1
"Cute tee shirt but it runs very large.i ordered a small and probably an xxs would have fit.unfortunately i have to return it.for reference i am 5'3"" and 110 lbs."	1
I love that this top is dressy, yet comfy. it is perfect for work and relaxing with friends after. i recommend purchasing this blouse.	1
I bought this top in a large. i washed it in cold water, and it shrank just enough to flatter. the material is great, in that when i washed it, the blouse hanged quite nicely, no ironing needed. also, the material is heavy enough that no tank is needed underneath the top. thakoon had made the same top last summer, and it had cost around $500. this top is even better due to the material, and i could buy it for a fraction of the price. highly recommend!	1
Man, this dress is the worst. i don't understand how it looks the way it does on the model. agree with previous reviewer - there must be a minimum of 200 pins pulling the waves and waves of extra fabric back. this dress looks so cute , but is so, so, so disappointing in person. sweater collar and cuffs - stiff and bulky. dress - billowy and sack-like - not sure how they got a belt to pull it all in. save yourself the return and do not get sucked in by the sale price and extra sale discount like	0
This dress references that it is off the shoulder in the description. but i did not find it to be so; it fits me as pictured on the model - sort of a ballet neck or wide scoop neck. in any case, the fabric is as pictured. and - it's lined! yay - not see through. the varying sizes of stripes give it interest despite the neutral colors. it is cute with a denim jacket and is really comfortable.	1
Not being into bright neon colors, i love this top! the fit is true to size and helps to hide my tummy. it's super cute and very flattering.	1
I'm a new mom, and am thrilled at the structure and quality of this dress. it gives me a great shape, very flattering. i can wear it to work with a jacket or dress it up with jewelry for a fancier event.	1
Love this jacket!got my usual size medium and is perfect! beautiful quality	1
I am five four and one hundred and twenty pounds and the small fits me perfectly with enough room in the arms and chest. i am a 34c. the red is gorgeous and sweet. got it on line sale and worth it	1
Love these pants. ordered in petite .,love style, great fit but so long .  keeping but have to get hemmed 2 1/2 inches.  decided to order the black & green as well.	1
Great dress! i am always looking for knee length dresses that are comfortable and easy to wear. i am really active with my kids and this dress can be worn on a casual day with sandals or dressed up. the fit was flattering for me, although i am not very curvy and could see that it might not flatter all shapes. i am 5'5'' and 120 pounds and the size four fit great.	1
"This is a very beautiful dress, with the detail of the inside lining, with a very beautiful fabric as well, creating a double layer effect, it creates a great flow. i am not sure i would use it with the belt (which is beautiful, a part of it is crochet), but if i don't, the dress would be too long. i am a size xl and 5'6"", so if you are shorter than that, i would try it before buying it. since it's getting cold here in colorado, i'll have to wait for next year to really experience going out with"	1
I love this top! tassels are not too big. material is thick. i wish is was a little longer though.	1
"This dress is just as it appears. it is very well made, lined and falls in heavier but fluid waves. the bodice fit snug and the zipper worked almost perfectly (!). the color is very pink, like pepto bismal but not in a bad way, if that's possible. my husband loved the dress on me but my 22 year old daughter thought it was too pink, too girly... i think i decided it was just too young for me- i'm 53. . alas, i am returning it but i still think fondly of this piece. i am 5'4"", 110 lbs and i bought"	1
Ordered in the orange and they are so cute i had to order the other two colors. my normal size 12 fit tts. i am happy with the fabric, fit and color. i have an athletic build and had no issues with the side zip, waist, hip or thighs.	1
Just got this vest in my store yesterday and i was immediately drawn to it. the outside of the vest is this thick knit in an oatmeal color and a bright cobalt blue (even brighter than it appears online). the inside is a jersey knit fabric in grey. its an eye catcher for sure. i knew i needed to try it on. the vest is longer in length (like it appears in the photos). my only gripe is the fit. its great around the neck...nice and full. but i wish the body of the vest was larger. it fits very much	1
I absolutely adore this shirt!!! the pinkish rosey color is beautiful and ended up being better than i had imagined. i will say that the shirt is a bit more casual than i thought it was going to be, the way it hangs or something..not really sure. nonetheless, it is perfect. can be dressed up or down, which is the best quality to have in any piece of clothing! i can tell i'm going to get a lot of wear out of it.	1
"This dress is a beautiful classic ! i am 5""3 113 size 0 fits perfectly !"	1
"Super cute. cotton is substantial enough not to show bra lines, but light enough to be summery & breezy. i misread ""xs"" and tried it on, thinking it was a medium, & oddly there's barely any difference among the xs, s, and m sizes--the buttons didn't even buckle out across my bust on the smaller sizes--so, this top could be a nice ego boost if you want to size down (i got the m anyway). armholes not too big, ruffle hides any tummy flaws. great with jeans, shorts, and skirts--like a perfect white"	1
I really like this dress! i wasn't sure what to expect when i ordered it, but was pleasantly surprised when it arrived. it fits well and it's very cute and different.	1
I bought 3 shirts in gold, black and red. they arrived larger than expected. after the first wash and air dry they shrunk. i would have been thrilled but they shrunk to be shorter while staying too wide. also my black shirt faded a lot with one wash.	0
First off the prints are gorgeous - i ordered three. i wanted to love them but unfortunately i found them short and wide. so back they go..	1
"This is a really great tunic. purchased it in black and it is very flattering. i love the side slit detail. the material may seem very casual, but it is extremely comfortable and can be dressed up. i'm 5'3"" 130lbs and a s fits perfect."	1
"Bought this dress on sale - i haven't decided if i'm going to keep it yet or not, because i'm not sure if it's flattering to my bubble butt. i normally wear a 6-8 in retailer (5'6"" 135 lbs thin limbs 38-26-38). i ordered this dress in a size 4 regular and i find the length perfect with flats or with heels. i also find the bust area, waist and hips accommodating without being tight, which usually never happens. for this current sale price, this is a gorgeous dress made with beautiful material."	1
I saw this dress a few weeks ago in the store, tried it on but didn't have anywhere in mind to wear it so i passed. noticed it on sale online and had to order. it is so comfortable and flattering. the material is thicker therefore it keeps a nice shape. not slinky at all.	1
"I tried this on in the store, in regular size (i often need petite). i think on this one, i could go either way. the cut is flattering fit and flare, and the colors are rich. i like the ""flowery"" design, good spring piece in my opinion, as it has components of all kinds of seasons: sleeveless and see-though material, buthe design part is almost like a fine corduroy, very soft. not too flimsy iether."	1
"Love the lace back panel, unique design. would not call this blue....definitely more of a grey color, but it is pretty! got size small and it fit well. 5'6"" 140 lbs."	1
I grabbed this during a 20% off sale so i will state first that i don't think this top is worth full price, and even at 20% off i wasn't wowed enough to pay that much for it. the colors are more saturated in person and very pretty. however, the cut- both the length and the width- just made it too overwhelming on my size 14/16 frame. i ordered the xl and it was wayyyy too big through the chest but sizing down to a large meant that it didn't flow over my hips as well because it's so long. i think	1
I fell in love with this dress when i saw it. i am usually a petite, so i knew it would hit me just above the ankle, but it works! what is lacking from the description is the under slip that comes with the dress. it is a knee length, cotton jersey slip that is bulky and uncomfortable - thus the 4 star rating instead of 5 star. i won't use the slip, so this makes the dress fairly sheer when backlit. otherwise, the dress is well made and the addition of the piping at the seams makes it special. i	1
Love the length and long sleeves. so comfy to sleep in! great purchase, i ordered the navy one too!!	1
Just purchased this sweater in store as a christmas present for my self and i'm in love! i feel the fit besides the shoulders which are somewhat narrow, is perfect. i usually wear a petite medium in everything but had to go with the regular small because they didn't have petites in the store. i tried on the regular medium and it was just slightly too big everywhere. overall i am so pleased with this purchase. so happy i popped into retailer today and saw it!	1
Love this dress! so cute and comfortable! good for all seasons, has a very nice under slip. only issue is that it will snag very easily. great color and i get lots of compliments!	1
I got this in the brown and absolutely love it. this is perfect for cool weather. i'm super particular about fabric quality and this cardigan does not disappoint	1
The material is awesome and it's a super pretty dress it just didn't work on my body.	0
"I'm 5'7"", 34c, 28 jeans, size 4 dress. one of these beauties ended up in our store and i had to try it on. the sleeves are no joke - serious bell sleeves that could have looked comical with the polka dots, but is surprisingly chic. the one i purchased was a medium - never had an opportunity to try a small, which i suspect is my actual size. buying it oversized made this magical. it feels modern. i actually think because the whole sweater is oversized on me, it makes the sleeves less cartoonish."	1
"This was a lovely skirt. the colors are beautiful, and the style is not too poofy like other ball skirts. it is very high waisted, and at 5'8"" the length was similar to the model."	1
"Fabulous colors, great fabric, super comfy and extremely versatile. i love, love, love this skirt. although i'm only 5'1"", the regular 2 was still above my knee so it might be a bit short for really tall gals. the waistband is a bit wide, but with a cropped top or tying a button down as shown, i found it very flattering. love the texture of the fabric and the slightly retro print and it doesn't seem to wrinkle (after getting out the original packaging creases). it honestly goes with everything a"	1
Great shirt that is basic with a little something extra. meadow rue does it again...i swear i buy everything they put out...	1
This is an adorable piece but the fit is a gamble. the crotch hung way too low for comfort on these so since i got a great sale price, i had them altered. i haven't worn them yet but i'm sure i'll get compliments when i do. so if you want to take chance on the fit and/or alter them, go for it!	0
I looked like i was going to work on a farm. well made, but seemed fit big. i like and have owned wide leg pants/capris, these were cartoonishly wide. needless to say, they were returned.	0
I love this tee, i bought it in white and the bright salmon pink and wished i could have bought it in all the colors. the v-neck is low enough to show just a hint of cleavage without being too revealing. the rough edge of the hem is a nice touch. i like the double-v neck in the back as well as front; it adds a little interest to the back and is not too low. the label is sewn on with red thread which shows up on the white color in back but in a nice way. overall the length and cut are just ideal.	1
I got this top in white and it is cute. the fabric is a weird kind of polyester, and kind of shiny. i got the medium and it pulls a little around the chest. overall i like it.	1
I'm an xl in retailer tops, and the xl in this blouse fit wonderfully. i bought the blouse in black, but will also probably purchase it in the cream. the blouse is made very nicely, however i had to deal with about 6 embroidered pieces that were not knotted. i had to take a needle, and thread the loose pieces to the back of the blouse and then knot them in with the rest of the embroidery. some of the individual flowers just came out entirely. however, this is such a stunning blouse and i feel so g	1
"Loved this dress. fit like a glove, so flattering, and perfect for a summer/fall wedding. material is substantial and dress is well made. i'm 5'4, large chest, and curvy, and a size 6 fit perfectly. longer than seen on the model for me, but i actually love it being tea-length.  a strip of tulle attached to the lining underneath the skirt to help it ""poof."" i removed it, but looks good either way."	1
After seeing this on anthto's facebook page i was so excited to order. i ended up going to a store and trying on. i couldn't believe it was the same shirts when i first saw it. i thought this ran quite big. and the shape was odd. lots of material in the middle. i am a mom of 3 young kids and didn't want people to think #4 was on the way.	0
"I was thrilled when this shirt arrived.  it is as cute in person as in the catalog.  it's soft, it fit perfect, and it looks great with shorts and pants.  it will be my ""go to"" shirt this summer."	1
"Ordered the xsp (5'4"" about 118-120#, athletic build)...this was huge all over. big in the armholes, too much fabric hanging in the skirt (cream fabric) front and back, not flattering at all from the sides and as long on me as it shows on the model. i love the idea of this and for the right body type (of course) this will be beautiful. it also would not be a very versatile piece for me...the top sweater part is quite thick (lovely) and heavy. in oklahoma this would not work for very many weeks.."	1
I fell in love with this trench when i first saw it online but ended up returning it once i tried it on. i'm 5'9, 140 lbs and the m fit true to size. but the belt hit above my natural waistline and the skirt of the coat was much fuller than i expected, making me look heavier. the material also wrinkles easily and the stitching was poor quality with lots of loose threads. disappointed, as the color and concept were great.	0
"Beautiful tee and cut with a classic, simple silhouette. nice weight and true to size. i'm 5'7"", 132# and the small fits me like i like. not tight at all, with room to allow for shrinkage. i really appreciate the higher cut of the neck as most tees i have purchased last several years i love for the overall fit and material but am a little self-conscious in due to the low cut neck. maybe if i weren't as small chested this wouldn't be an issue for me. i definitely recommend this tee."	1
This top is just as beautiful in person as online. however, it has two issues for me. 1. it is too short. this might work if you have a short torso, but it would forever show my stomach. 2. the fabric has way too much static cling. no matter what i tried, it just clung to my stomach and flared out at the sides. not attractive. in short, if you have a short torso and don't mind battling the static, this truly is a beautiful top.	1
I love this top! the unique neck detail is awesome! i dress it up; i dress it casual. works for every adventure. more!!!	1
"I would give it a 3.5 if half star possible. like other reviews said, the material is a little cheap and back zip got stuck when i tried to unzip it before trying it on. overall, nice color and flattering look that could be dress up or down. i am 5'8"", 155lbs, 36b and m is a little snug for me on the top."	1
This blouse is easily one of the nicest i have bought in recent times. the quality is excellent, the design demonstrates that design and nature are extremely compatible. i have worn this blouse with jeans and in a more formal situation and with a little more jewelry, the blouse fits in perfectly anywhere. i highly recommend it.	1
A lovely, creatively designed tunic that just isn't for me.  the embroidery is certainly intricate and the chambray shirt has a wearable hand, but the combination on my body type didn't look quite right, probably because i am too top heavy and apple torsoed.  i think if i were more slender, the fit would look like a flattering dress.  i had purchased the size 10 and i am 36dd 140#.	1
"Maybe it's my curves or the way i'm only 5'4"" but this was a hot mess on me! it is soooo long and cut to low for my 36d chest. it is slim and the cut usually is flattering but somehow this dress was anything but! it is really shiny and the material is heavier than anticipated for warm weather. if you are super tall and skinny with no boobs, go for it! had to send back!"	0
Ok. so this coat is amazing! it's high quality, soft, great pattern. the knit lining helps to make this more of a light weight coat than a sweater type coat. it's been warmer this season so i've worn it as a coat and received many compliments. it might not be warm enough for january in new england but i bought a size up so i could wear it over a sweater and still use it as a coat. this was purchased on sale w 25% off sale code, so for me, that was a steal. so happy it went on sale! give it a try	1
Quite cute, it feels good on. the fit is tts and the colors are bright and just as depicted. i am a medium in most of retailer clothes and this fit nicely.	1
I wasn't sure the shorter length in the back was working until i tried it on. this jacket totally worked for me. the brown color can be easily matched with other colors. i got the jacket in medium size. i usually in between size. the medium size allow more space on the chest area, however the sleeve becomes a bit too long for me.	1
Kicky looking pants, that i got at a bargain basement steal. i'd be kicking myself if i didn't buy them. can't wait to wear them once it warms up. they'll look great with a lightweight, boxy sweater and flats. i tried on the 4 and the 2 and the 2 is perfect. the fabric has a nice, fluid feel to it. i always swore to my husband i'd never wear plaids, but i guess i lied.	1
I wanted to love this dress, however it has no shape to it. it is also somewhat see through, so something needs to be worn under it. i feel like i received a dress that has been stretched out and returned. i'm extremely disappointed. i do not recommend.	0
Extremely flattering. an easy dress to wear - good choice for both day and evening	1
I love, love, love this sweater.  it is slightly fitted so that is drapes beautifully.  notice it has 3/4 length sleeves which is fine for north caroline where it does not really get cold.  i purchased the blue and i wore it with fitted jeans.	1
"Got these on sale...absolutely love eberjey! fabric is super soft and easy to wash. more ""normal"" than other eberjey styles (not lingerie). i'm 5'6"", 125 lbs and small fit well. i am small busted and there is definitely extra room but doesn't make it fit weird at all. highly recommend!"	1
Love this vest! since i am 66 years old i was hesitant to try on this vest because it was out of my comfort zone as to style, but my daughter convinced me to try it on. it is absolutely darling and looked so chic on. my 27 year old daughter bought it, too, so it is stylish for any age. the fur collar is fun and the fabric is very nice and the vest is well made. it can elevate jeans to a dressier look but still have a casual vibe. having a coupon the day we shopped made the decision to buy this e	1
Was looking for a cute off the shoulder top and this is a fun one. can be worn both on or off the shoulders. nice length and the pink is a beautiful raspberry color. love the linen blend too. i'm a size 2 and i ordered the xs. flows away from body - -it's a bit big but i like the style.	1
I understand what the previous reviewer meant when she says these are great for around the house. the yarn is thick but the weave is open so they are nicely springy but not very warm. they look perfect with my birkenstocks so i'm getting then in all colors.	1
These are very pretty, but i have had a few problems with them. out of the package, i found them to be true to size. i think i purchased the pxxs or the pxs. however, even though they are machine washable, i feel that they shrunk upon washing and are now too short (i am barely over 5' tall). also, the elastic waistband keeps twisting within the casing, which drives me crazy. i have to keep straightening it. i think there are better options for sleep pants.	0
Ordered the pink in a small, but it ran big...the xs was perfect for my 5'6' medium frame. it is comfortable and the fabric has an interesting texture. looks great with chinos or jeans. might need to get the other color.	1
I saw this shirt in store a while ago, but could not believe the price and was not about to spend my money on it. however, when it went on sale and there was an extra 40%, i decided to get it. i like the top, it's cute and fun. however, it does poof out a little in the midline. this top goes great with jeans or shorts, and it is cute, but definitely not worth full price for this.	1
This lovely cardigan is just that much more special due to the lining on the body and in the pockets. they peek out and make the sweater more interesting. i wore the black one with a lace dress with cream underlayment and the cream details on the lining worked perfectly to offset the formality of the dress and make the whole outfit casual but chic. the sweater washed in the machine and kept its shape when i hung it to dry.	1
My new favorite piece of loungewear. super cute and comfortable.	1
This top caught my eye in the store due to the beautiful print and lovely fabric. the photo really doesn't do it justice. i happened to have on a pencil skirt when i tried it on and the top looked great with my skirt though i will probably wear it more often with jeans or pants. it's a stunner!	1
This is my first pair of mcguire jeans, and i like the fabric and fit.  thank goodness for petite sizing!  these 32p fit just right on my hips, with no gap between the waistband and my body.  fits through thigh and hips and pretty slim all the way down.  nice stretch.  of course, the proof will be after wearing a few times and washing.  i will update my review if i do not like them so much after that,	1
Great style and fit. will look great with jeans, skirt or leggings!	1
I wear an 8-10 and these are a little big on me, which is surprising. they also don't lay really flat in the back. the pockets are inside in the back, in side two layers, and don't lay very flat. the crotch is low and rides up when i walk. i'll probably wear them again, but i'm not totally thrilled by them.	0
"So i wasn't sure about ordering this skirt because i couldn't see it in person first but i'm so glad i did. the skirt and design is well made and doesn't look or feel cheap. the color isn't blaring, offensive red so it worked with my pale skin better than i anticipated. i wore it to my daughter's dance production with tall boots and a sweater and i got numerous compliments. fit is true, i am 5'2"" and i picked the petite length. the skirt has a slight a-line rather than a tight pencil fit but the"	1
Truly. adorable. as other reviewers have mentioned, much better in person than as pictured. the ivory has black, khaki and light pink polka dots. it is great with a pencil skirt or pants.	1
This dress is gorgeous! i bought the patterned dress and it has the perfect colors for the season. the pictures just do not do it justice. plus it is incredibly comfortable. this dress could easily be dressed it up or down and is perfect for someone who is curvy on top. i can't wait to wear this on a date!	1
I am a curvy size 8. i loved the colors but found it looked maternity when unbelted and there was too much bunchy fabric at the waist when tied. i tend to like things that emphasize my waist, however.	0
This dress is really cute in person. however, it did not fit me like it does the model in the pic at all. first of all i'm 5 feet 1 and it was wayyy too short on me. i didn't have the petit on either-- i had the regular xs. it just hits a couple of inches too short for me. i am 50. it would be adorable if i were more comfortable in shorter dresses. i wear short things a lot, but this was just too high on me. it was probably a good 8 inches above my knee. also it flared too dramatically at the wa	1
This sweater is lovely! i have worn it every other day since i got it. it is soft and warm and elevates everything that you wear it with. i have gotten compliments every time i've worn it. my daughter, who rarely likes the style of clothes i wear, said i looked like a winter princess in this! it is so flattering and comfortable---a winning combination!	1
"These are really nice jeans (i am a jean fanatic). some ""patches"" are faded others are dark with still others with stitching across them. very distinctive and nice. they are truly a boyfriend fit...so, if you them big, they are. ag makes very nice jeans both in fit and quality. i buy other brands, but not often..."	1
Fits great and i love the length. very cute skirt!	1
I recently purchased this vest and unlike other reviews, i found it to be tts. with that being said, i am typically a medium in retailer tops or 8/10. i have broad shoulders (5'9, 145lbs). i purchased the medium and it fit perfect through the shoulders. it is meant to be flowy and gives some volume in a good way. if that's the look you are going for this is the top for you. had i gone down a size, i would not have been able to hook the top. i am going to be wearing this with blue jeans and white s	1
"I think this fits to true to size. i am 5""2 and 107 lbs. i always wear a xs. it was a tiny bit tight in the bust if i wore a big padded bra (34b). if i wore a normal very little padding bra, it did not pull much across the bust."	1
The design looked super cute online, but in person, the material seemed cheap. actually, at least in the green one, the material is different in the striped and solid sections; if it had all been the striped material, it would have been much nicer.	0
Very cute top. does require a strapless bra as the straps are further out than most tops, and they also tend to fall down. also, while the top fit well, the top button gaps are far apart and tended to separate to show my chest. easy fix with a snap sewed in.	1
I returned this dress because the material is so flimsy and thin. i was expecting higher quality, especially for the price. i was disappointed. it is a pretty dress and fit great, but i felt like i was wearing tissue paper.	0
Great detailing in how it's made. may look best on someone who's slender. it runs small and will show if you have even slight curves.	1
Beautiful dress! the pics online do not do any justice! i got compliments all day!	1
I got this dress in navy for my engagement photos and i got so many compliments on the design and fit of the dress. it's very comfortable and stretchy so i got a 6 petite and it fit perfectly, where normally i need an 8 or a 10 because clothes are made so tight now. it was light weight and fit great in the bust and fell nicely over the hips. and for the bottom of the dress being white, it surprisingly wasn't see through. i wouldn't go wearing bright red under the dress but there is definitely no	1
Love these! i am a medium in shorts or 29-30, and the medium fit perfectly.. true to size, very soft, flattering cut and color. love the embroidery. great for travel, very light and can be jazzed up a little with nice sandals, almost like a flirty little short skirt. the fullness and non fitted look is great for a less than perfect tummy. i am very happy with this purchase.	1
Flattering to the figure. i'm bustier and slightly thicker waisted but this jumpsuit hugs and drapes in all the right places. normally i wear a medium petite but the regular small fit better (win!) i'm disappointed in the dye quality- my hands were blue from trying on the different sizes and i'm now on my second wash before wearing.	1
"I love this style. reminds me of what we used to wear back in the 70's. it's very cute, flattering, and material is a high quality. will look good with skinny or boot cut jeans. if you like this ""baby doll"" style, you'll love this."	1
This is a great pair of trousers for work but can also be dressed down. they are very flattering and runs true to size. they're also a bit highwaisted which i love. my only complaint is that they are unlined. i'm not sure why a nice pair of wool trousers would be unlined. however i'm still giving them 5 stars because the fit and quality outweigh the one con.	1
Such a festive sweater and i've received many compliments anytime i wear it. unique and fun to wear!	1
Cute top. definitely sheer so need an undershirt. really love details on it, especially back and fringe at bottom. 5'4, 135 lbs, ordered s.	1
This is a beautiful piece. the fabric is a nice weight and the cut of the lace across the shoulders is flattering. the sleeves are dramatic, but not overly fussy. sadly i returned the dress because although it is a swing style (no waistline), it has a very straight cut. i was hoping it was more of an a-line silhouette to accommodate my hips, but alas. if you self-identify as a pear, this may not be the dress for you.	1
"I've been buying pilcro for years. they are good quality, comfortable and wear well. my only complaint is (and this a general complaint of all pants today) is that these are cropped. i have a 35"" inseam. these stop well above my ankle but i love the color and the general fit. i'm used to having most of my pants (even those labelled tall) be too short so i don't mind it too much. i feel as though it runs a little big due to how much stretching that happens as you wear them. it's pretty much a tra"	1
Love this! when i first saw it online, i thought it was a bit pricey for a plain white shirt. but i finally gave in and ordered it! i'm so glad i did! i've worn it twice in one week so it won't be difficult to get my money's worth! it's very soft and fits perfectly. looks great with jeans or dress pants. i like to tuck the front in my pants and leave the back out.	1
I like the idea of the pullover. the quality of is nice; the material is very soft and feels pleasant to the touch. i expected this sweater to be more flattering though. it is true to size, but the length is strange. it seems a bit too long, yet is too short to look like a longer tunic. or maybe the waistline is a little low... whatever it is, it makes me look like i have short legs. also, the collar won't stay down, the way it is shown in the picture. but it may work better for someone wi	1
This dress is gorgeous. flattering, comfortable, and machine washable! for reference i am 5'5 145lbs, 38-30-40 and 34dd. i got the medium and it fits great! only flaw is that the armholes are a little large, but not enough that my bra shows so i am okay with it.	1
I wanted this dress in wine for a holiday party. but it just has no life whatsoever. unlike prior reviewer, i found nothing to dislike about the fabric. the fabric is fine and the fit is fine. i'm sometimes an 8 and sometimes a 6; took this in an 8 and definitely would not size down. it's relatively close- and well-fitting, but the sleeves and neckline further ruined it for me. the sleeves are shapeless, long and baggy. the neckline is just blah. it needs to be neater, trimmer, more cut. the ruc	0
I loved this top from the first time i saw it online. i ordered a size 10 ~i'm slim with broad shoulder & 36c~ the top fit perfect. when i opened the pkg i thought it would be too big since it looked wide but that was not the case at all. its a little longer in the back & a little shorter in the front. on me~it looks exactly like it does in the picture.its really a cute top & it looks lovely over shorts. makes a cute, casual summer outfit. i cant wait to wear it.	1
Lovely crochet lace tunic. also very comfortable. doesn't wrinkle and the cotton has a lovely feel.	1
I like the color and design. it looked super cute when i tried it on, but when i brought it home, i washed it in the washing mashine and hung it to dry and it shrank before i even got to wear it. be careful with washing it!	1
I love this tunic! it runs slightly large. i ordered my usual size small (i am 5'4'' 125lbs) and it is a looser fit but falls nicely. i wear it as a dress, and the blue/gray color is so pretty!	1
The sweater is prettier in person than online. great quality, tight knit, overall good purchase. however, it does run small. i would absolutely size up. i am a size 4 with a 34 c chest and i ordered a m and i would have been happy with a roomier l. i was going to return to my local store but they were sold out in the larger sizes. i will keep it because it's gorgeous and i'll make do with the less relaxed fit, but it doesn't look on me like it does on the model.	1
I bought this dress when i saw it go on sale, and i am glad i did! love how it fits the length everything about it. it is true to size and it looks very flattering, i will be wearing it for my anniversary date with my husband. highly recommend! i am 130 lbs, 34d, and the size 6 fit perfectly!	1
I'm so glad to own this one. i just tried it today and fully satisfied as always with pilcro. true to size, perfect color. high waisted and flare just right. can be paired with cropped top or peasant top. looking taller on this outfit! best of all i got it on sale!	1
"I am 5'6"" and run between a size 9-10 pant. i ordered the size 10 skirt and the waist fit perfectly and so did the back of the skirt, which i was afraid might be loose (i don't really have a butt but it fits nicely). looks like the picture so the skirt goes straight down, it does not taper to smaller width like some regular pencil skirts might so the bottom part will not be fitted, for your reference. the denim actually has quite a lot of stretch so it's very comfortable as well as the waistband"	1
I purchased these pants in blue, they fit great - only problem is that one leg is about 1/2 inch longer than the other. i got them on sale with a discount so i will keep them and take them to a tailor to fix. bummer.	1
I ordered a small and i'm usually always a small. i could not zip it up. i'm am returning it for a large, and this is concerning because what if it is big in a weird way because i'm usually a large?	0
I love this. it is perfect. it is sheer, but i wear a black cami underneath and it looks great. so glad antro finally has something with a waist! the small metal buttons are a really nice added detail. i wish you would make more tops with a defined waist like this one!	1
I got this sweater in white and i love it. the photo online doesn't do it justice, it's not frumpy at all and looks looks great zipped up because of the slanted zipper. my boyfriend calls it my claire underwood sweater.	1
I wish i could keep this dress based on the pretty orange print and style but the fabric and details make this a return, even on sale price :( agree with previous reviews: bodice too tight, neckline too high/chokes, fabric is rough, outer is poorly attached to liner so it poofs in weird areas. too bad...so sad!	0
They make your butt look great! very whimsical design.	1
"I wanted to love this dress! the material is beautiful! but sadly i agree with other reviewer. the model definitely has this pinned back! i am on the small side (5'5"", 120 lbs, straight figure, very tiny ""girls"") and this dress looked awful. totally swallowed what little shape i have and the swing did make me look prego in front and back. the fabric is stiff so i think that adds to the sticking out oddly. as far as sizing the arm jokes fit great. xs ordered and length was good but wish the ""swin"	0
"This shirt arrived today, and i was surprised how short it is. not a tunic at all. i wonder if the lengths on these vary, and if i order it again, it would be a different length. i ordered my normal size, xs petite. i'm 5-2"", so this should have been a tunic on me. perhaps if i see this shirt in the store, i'll try on the regular length. i'm returning the petite!"	0
I love the ease of wearing and styling this top. i am very pleased with the construction. glad i ordered it!	1
In theory, this dress was perfect for me. the colors, the embroidery, the sheer top and keyhole back... so romantic! sigh. something about the fit just kept it from being a wow moment. i'm usually 10-12, the 12 was way too big, the 10 more fitted, but still it wasn't quite right. the sheer part dips quite low, and sizing down helped, but it could still be a lil dangerous. i kept feeling like it wasn't defining my waist enough and wanted a tighter waist and more full skirt. maybe i would have fel	1
This wash fits differently than other pilcro jean leggings. the rise is higher and the fit is larger/bulkier through the waist and hips. i love pilcro legging jeans, so the fit difference is kind of disappointing. i recommend trying this wash on first to see if you need a smaller size. i got the same size i always get in this style and this wash is definitely not as flattering as other pairs i own.	1
Beautiful top and beautiful bright color. this does run 2 sizes small in arms and chest unless you are very narrow in stature and flat chested . i am usually a size 6 and a 36c and broad shoulders and size 10 just its in underarm area. i have short torso so love the length but those with very long torso may find this blouse too short. if you get the right size this topics really adorable. my husband also gave it a big thumbs up.	1
I loved the style and shape of the dress . it does run small. i had to return it because some of the black dots pulled and looked like it might be more of a problem as i wore it	0
This dress is so soft, and fits like a dream. i'm a new mom and the tie perfectly masks what's left of my mummy tummy, while still helping me feel stylish for fall!	1
I really loved the colors in this dress and was looking for a long sleeve dress. this style may just be big fitting but the sleeves were way too long and the dress was just shapeless on me. i usually wear a small or a size 4 in clothing and the size small in this dress was way too big. the x-small may have been a better fit but this dress was on backorder and i just received it right before we are going on a trip. there's no time to order the x-small but maybe i can look at it again when we retu	1
"I was at first a bit leery of this dress because of the shape. baggy is in, but it's not always flattering. i am usually a big small-medium and the medium was too fluffy. i realize it's supposed to be loose, but not that loose. i'm 5'8"" and 146 lbs and the small was the best option. perfect amount of looseness but still gave a hint of shape. it has pockets and is so comfortable. i'm a school teacher so i try to find clothes that i can wear in both worlds. this is definitely a keeper! i will for"	1
I love this dress so much. the fabric on top is not something i would have chosen-it is thick and almost an elastic kind of feel. but i have grown to appreciate that since this dress is not amenable to most bras. i think the fabric would be thick enough on top to actually just do without one. otherwise you would have to go with a strapless-and the right kind of strapless, with this dress. when they say it flares it really does-and much more than i was expecting. the bottom part of the skirt f	1
The dress is true to fit and very soft. you can dress it up or be casual with a denim jacket.	1
This will be perfect for the mild fall weather in texas. it's light weight and i love that the top is a little more fitted and the bottom swings out.	1
Quality is great, fits very well at waste, i am 5'4 135lb bought size 8p and it's good... i would require wear heels as it reaches and sits on the floor. they are more fall/spring/winter pants as material quite thick. overall, i am happy with them	1
This print is beautiful and the design is unique and great for work. my only complaint is that it runs huge and the torso fit is extremely boxy. i'm normally in between a size xs and s at retailer, bought the xs in this shirt and it still almost too big.	1
These are the most flattering pair of white jeans i have ever found!! people stop me when i wear them and ask me where i purchased them and the name of the brand! flattering, comfortable and perfect for a casual weekend or going out! highly recommend!	1
"This dress is wonderful and the petite sizing is really for petites! (i have recently returned two dresses and a skirt that were way too large in the petite offering...so i was not really expecting this dress to fit so well!) i ordered in the 2p. i am 5'4"" about 120#. it fits beautifully...even though it's a tad bit loose in the arm openings and i think i could have sized down to the 0p (it is no longer available though). but this dress drapes so lovely and the material is so thin that there is"	1
I am 4ft 11and 114 lbs. and i tried on the regular 0 and 2. the 2 fit  better but there was too much extra material in the back so i order the 2 petite. the 2 petite fit perfectly, very classic in the front with the right amount of flow in the back. i can't wait to wear this to work or out to dinner with the girls.	1
Great tights with good color and quality. i got a lot of compliments on my head to toe retailer ensemble!	1
"I loved it but can understand the mixed reviews. i am 5'7"" and a size 2-4 usually. 32d. you need to be on the tall side for it to work. definitely will not work if you are petite. i can also see if you have a fuller chest how it would tent and look like a maternity top. i have that happen with off the shoulder styles. that said, if it works, it is great. i didn't size down went with s) because the xs didn't hang well. it was too short at the shoulders and neckline. again, probably need to be in"	1
Totally pretty but not crazy flattering. a bit wide in the hip area if you are not tall. good on sale but i wouldn't pay full price.	1
Easy breezy top that goes with so many outfits. i am petite (5'0'', 115lb), but like the longer look of a top, so went with 4r, thought that the arm holes would be too small if went with 2r. there is a lot of excess material around the sides...and back. i was tempted to return, but the armhole issue prevented me and it was so cute, i kept it. i think it will go through the a few seasons (seattle is unpredictable weather-wise...) and can be easily layered. i like the blouse...but don't love.	1
Perfect substitute for leggings to wear with a long shirt skirts or shorts. and are thick enough to keep you warm and aren't as thin as some tights normally are.	1
I love these jeans, cant believe i never purchased them earlier. i'm always a 30 in paige and ag and this was no different. i will say that i did fit into the 29, so it could be that they run slightly large. the fabric is amazing!! and the white is perfect. love that it is not see through and fabric is substantial.the length for me at 5'5 was at my ankle. i loved them so much that i bought them in white and beige/cream. highly recommend.	1
The first time i wore it, felt wonderful. had it cleaned and then the back end stated pilling. very disappointed with the price and quality. wish i could return for my money back. sad	0
Just bought this cardigan today. i'm already a fan of left of center and was happy with this piece. it's soft, has more interest to it than your average cardi. the sleeves are a bit long, but it's not a dealbreaker. i imagine it will be a great transitional piece from summer to fall and then for spring time.	1
Beautiful print, however as the previous reviewer mentioned it is very sheer, much sheerer than the product shot shows. i was expecting to be able to wear a nude bra under this without a cami, however my nude bra was completely visible. the top also ended at the middle of the zipper of my jeans, so much shorter than the tunic length shown, and the bottom half of the sleeves ballooned out much more noticeably in person (the top half of the sleeves are slim, and the bottom half are looser). over	0
"This dress is extremely comfortable and flattering. it has a forgiving a line shape to it for women like me who are pear shaped. the top of the dress is made of a heavy type of cotton material and the bottom tiers are made of a silky material that hangs beautifully! even the tie closure in the back of the dress adds a lovely touch to the dress. i would recommend wearing it with leggings ( as shown with the model) or black tights. the fit is true to size. i am 5'6"" and the length is a liittle low"	1
I loved this jacket the minute i saw it. saturday sunday is one of my favorite brands. even cuter on than the photo. short back at natural waist long in front . great quality fabric. thick and warm. fits very narrow in sleeves so i went from small to medium to have room for a top underneath. the medium is perfect. back is stylish, solid tweed grey with front pattern wrapped around from front. sleeves and collar a black diamond pattern and ribbon trimmed edge.overall very interesting grey black c	1
I love this tunic, the detail the weight, the fringe. but it runs big. i would have done better to have ordered one size smaller. i think it would have looked more tailored if i had gotten the medium.	1
I wanted this romper so bad, after buying (and loving) a shirt from madewell made with the same fabric earlier this year. i wish this romper was just a little bit longer and roomier. i normally wear a size 10 or 12 and bought the large. it fit me ok but i felt like i wanted it to be just a little bit more oversized around my hips and definitely wanted it to be longer in the legs. (retailer please stop with the capri lengths! it's tired!!) if you are narrow-hipped you will fare much better. the fab	1
One wash wonder...i'm a s to m and went with a m but could have gone with a s with ease. after washing it was way shorter. it shrunk more than a whole size in cold water! i assumed everything came preshrunk but sadly disappointed. great for one wear.	0
I bought this dress for work and receive tons of compliments when i wear it! the material is soft and breathable, which makes it comfortable to wear all day at work with a light jacket. i do agree with the other reviewer though, it does show every bump, especially in the tummy. i also noticed that some of the fabric flaps will flip up when i sit down, but i am going to sew the flap down so it stops doing that.	1
I am currently loving anything that crosses or ties around the stomach area to hide what's left from my most recent pregnancy. this tunic fits the bill. the material has the perfect amount of stretch and the length was just right. i am very petite and bought my usual size xs. i would have liked to try this tunic in a petite size, but then it  may have been too short. i plan on wearing this to work with leggings and for running errands once the weather warms up.	1
This shirt is so cute! i was unsure about how flowy the sleeves would be- as i'm not one for frills- but the sleeves sit nicely. also, i am between a size small and medium, i got the small and it definitely is flowy. runs big, so if you like a tighter fit you may want to order a size down. i got the red and it's a perfect autumn / winter color. the cut outs are not too showy- so it's not revealing for us gals who are a little more belly-conscious. it's the perfect shirt to just throw on and go a	1
Love love this skirt! such a pretty green color and a great quality. this will be a staple in my closet for years to come. and i love a skirt with pockets.	1
I agree the pictures are confusing. the front top of the dress is not cut out as some pictures seem to indicate. this is such a great dress! it has a great lining underneath and is really flattering and nicer/dressier looking in person than i imagined it would be. i think it fits true to size. i either wear a 4 or a 6 in most retailer dresses and the 4 in this dress fits me well. i'm planning to wear this dress to my bridesmaids luncheon! i definitely recommend!	1
The neckline is beautiful! it's super soft and comfy. sadly, my normal large looked very boxy. i am hoping the medium will fit better.	1
I wanted this dress so bad for a trip to hawaii. i sized up when i saw the side zip because i'm a little larger in the top than bottom, but whoa... even when sizing up, i think i would have needed to size up like 3x to get this to work. the dress is adorable, and if you have a smaller bust, it will work for you... so sad it wouldn't work for me.	0
Very beautiful colors unfortunately the cut is much too tent- like and it looks like a maternity top on me. i like a flowy bohemian top but this one was too much for my tastes, sadly i sent it back.	1
This dress comes with a built in fupa. literally there is extra material at the lower abdomen that sticks out and is very unflattering.	0
I first saw this jacket hanging at the store and it didn't look very cute. i saw it again on sale so i decided to try it on. i'm so glad i did! the inside gray material is so soft. i have broad shoulders and this jacket did not hinder my arms at all. it is very comfortable. i bought the x-small and was very surprised at how roomy it was. the sleeves are a tad bit long but the gray inner lining has an elastic cuff so it can be pushed up. not sure if the xx-small would've been too small or if the	1
These pants are perfect for crisp fall weather and comfortable! i wear them with flats to dress down or heels to dress up! recommended for all shapes!	1
"I ordered this in a size 1 which i thought would be a small and it was very, very wide. it is very short too. i typically wear a small and am 5'8"" and 132 lbs. it's going back unfortunately. very soft material though."	0
I love these jeans! well worth the price. waist hits just right. the stretch is great. i can wear them with riding boots, booties, and flats. i love them!	1
My only reservation is that i wish the tail wasn't so much longer than the front. i returned it reluctantly because i needed something just a little dressier for the occasion.	1
I was very excited to receive this dress because of the cute photo. however, upon arrival i was completely disappointed. the color is much more drab than the photo. the smudged polkadots weren't attractive. there were many little bumps and pulls in the linen. the dress is super heavy. the pleats around the waist did not lay correctly. and it adds 10 pounds to your hips! super sad! i am sending it back.	0
I wanted this so much that i purchased it at full price. i purchased the light denim in a petite small. this dress would be flattering on any figure. i am an hourglass and it is so flattering on me. i am also busty and this dress fits quite nicely as well. the material is thicker and somewhat stiff in a positive way. it has substance and the detail zipper on the back is different. this brand has never let me down. the tie doesn't have to look like the one in the picture. i made a lose double kn	1
Love the easy fit of this dress. great for work or family events. love the ribbed sleeves and pockets are a plus!	1
I immediately loved the rich royal blue color of this sweater with its pretty flower, nice fabric and medium weight. nice warm sweater.i have an retailer skirt just like the photo, great outfit. i am happy i ordered it, but hope it shrinks after washing.the small is very big and boxy, sleeves long. i am 5'6 medium build. small usually fits me well. i recommend downsizing or you will probably take this back.	1
I love this dress. i think it will be awesome to wear this summer but also a great transition piece into fall. very boho!	1
Review title says almost all. add to that that it is age appropriate, unlike other kedia dresses, for the very young. just too cute for words. i have all of the other tk peasant dresses and although youthful they are appropriate for anyone young of heart. this however, on an older woman, looks ridiculous. i would have liked it for those 9 months but even then it would cover quadruplets!	0
Was actually looking for something completely different and then walked into this dress. i have already a few events lining up for the summer months, and i could see this working on those hot summer days. i'm short and curvy so i tried on the large in store (i'm busty) and ended up ordering the petite l online. the top part fits proportion wise better with petite while a l gives my larger bust size enough room. i love the 3/4 length, i feel a great length when you're only 5'1, will look great wi	1
I really liked the look of the orange so ordered an xs. i prefer a s petite but it is sold out. the xs arrives and while i still like the color, the fit is really weird. the cowl is very high up but the sleeves are still long. it looks nothing like the photo. i cannot see how the cowl sits on the model's collar bone. despite eliding the color, the design is off so have to return.	0
"I really liked this dress when i tried the navy on in the store. i am 5'4"", 140 lb. and the medium fit me really well. unfortunately, i am not comfortable showing a lot of leg so the dress was just too short for me. if it had come to the tops of my knees i would have gone for it but it was well above my knees. the fit and color were great though, i loved the neckline and the material was very soft and comfortable. i tried the large but, while it was a little longer, the larger size made it lose"	1
I bought these in the mustard color and the salmon color.  i didn't have a problem with general fading, but used natural, mild stain remover (biokleen) and the pants were ruined. one faded where i sprayed and the other has a permanent water mark.  cold wash and line dried. such a bummer that these pants aren't every day wearable and washable!	0
Cute sweater! the side panels are perforated so you may want to wear either a nude bra or a cami underneath..	1
I love this dress! my goal is to have a closet full of clothes that are really cute and stylish, but are also very comfortable... this dress fit the bill. the mixture of the fabrics is even more cute in person than it looks online, and the fabric is so soft, it almost feel like wearing pajamas. the weight of the fabric also makes it hang really nicely, and so it's flattering. overall, a great addition to my spring/summer wardrobe.	1
I love the unique design! the details are wonderful. it runs a bit large but it works. a great piece.	1
I love peasant shirts so wanted to try it. cute top, but v-neck was lower than i was expecting. i have to wear an undershirt under this for that and also because of sheerness. fyi- shirt is off-white so stark white cami didn't work. was struggling to find something, but have the leana v-neck in navy- worked perfect and follows neckline exactly. now really cute! need something not long sleeves to wear under for spring weather here, but will keep and try to figure it out. 5'4, 135 lbs, ordered xs.	1
Material is so thin this shirt ripped in three places after wearing only once. got a size larger than i needed as i have a larger chest and even though it's a bit lose the thread has ripped material on my chest and in the armpits.	0
This goes well for cool weather. great with jeans or other casual pants. i got the green, it's more of a teal color but pretty. runs large. i usually run between small and medium, i got the small and it's a tad too loose on me.	1
I wanted these culottes to work so much! the fabric is gorgeous, but the size i ordered didn't fit. i'm normally a size 28 in pants, and i ordered a size 8. it was way too tight and made me look like i had a pooch in the zipper area. not what i wanted it to be. had to return them unfortunately.	0
Love the color and design but way to small. i can wear a small in many manufacturers but certainly not in this one. the medium was like an extra small. sorry because i liked what i saw in the advertisement. as an older lady i love your well made, fresh, styles but need to be able to trust that a size is true to form.	0
Shirt fits great! i wore it for work and got lots of complements. looks very elegant. i also got the pants featured on the model since i liked the outfit so much ;)	1
I put a lot of hopes on this pullover. i needed something for the spring, and it seemed perfect. plus, the sale price is very attractive compared to the regular retailer prices. but... i am not exactly disappointed, but i'd say surprised.  i would still consider this sweater good for spring. it's thin enough to be tucked into a skirt or pants if you like. the pullover is very stretchy - frankly, i would prefer it to be less stretchy, but that might be a plus for someone more busty. the quality	0
I really wanted this. they had two size small in my local retailer, both were damaged. so disappointing. i don't want to pay shipping for one that hopefully isn't damaged:( in the last year i've had multiple quality control issues with retailer. makes me gun shy. not sure i'm getting what i pay for anymore.	0
"I have been wanting this sweater and decided to order. when i received it, there was no tag on the product. it was not in a typical clear bag from retailer and it wasn't packaged nicely. it came from reno, nv. most products i order do not get shipped from there. it is short, and i'm 5'1"". most clothes that are short fit me with no problem. this sweater might hit me at the waist, or maybe shorter. i think the color is nice and the sweater is soft but not what i wanted. i am going to return it"	0
"I'm a m/l size in most things....depending on the maker and design. i tried this vest on with the paired top in the photo and couldn't believe how big and boxy it was. very boxy. it looked dumpy on my 5'3"" frame. i thought it might work because i have broad shoulders to hang the vest off,but noooo. i have breast and that ruined it. well there you go, a size 36c wasn't going to help with this one. but i'm going to try sizing down to a small to give it a chance in fitting better. it runs at least"	1
This is a great cut and looks good on. it is a very poor quality material. it balled and frayed in two wears. i returned it to the store.	0
Love the print of this fabric & the length. the buckles at the waist add a unique look so no belt necessary.	1
Saw this in the store and loved it! the photos on line do not do this justice. material is soft and substantial. if you love the look of raw edge you'll love this piece. as usual i wish it were a bit shorter even in petites as i am only 5' but kept it and love it.	1
I ordered the xs p and xxs p in the black one. i thought this would be a fairly classic piece to wear any season (cold offices in the summer, southern california in the winter). the xxs p was a bit better fitted, not too small, but the xs p was ok too, if you prefer a baggier look, so based on that i call it large as i would usually purchase the xs p not xxsp. (115 lbs, 30 dd, 26.5in waist, muscular arms) the material is airy and light, but i am a little worried about wrinkling, we shall see.	1
I love this tunic! perfect for the beach or by the pool! gorgeous design and even better in person! light weight, i am usually a small/medium and originally bought the small but ended up returning for the medium so i had a little more room up top for wearing over my swimsuit.	1
I am really happy with these jeans. fun fit, high waisted, great detail, and have just the right amount of stretch. i have worn them 4 times and haven't washed them yet (i find this helps shape my new jeans) and they still fit like a comfortable glove. a different twist on the ripped up jeans because of the color! love them! i normally fit a 29, ordered 28 in these and they are perfect!	1
I love the idea of this top. it's made really well. the only issue is its a bit shorter than i thought and the neckline rubs on my neck.	1
I love this shirt. it would be a fairly basic tee but the neckline makes it fun. it's very soft and comfortable. i bought the white with blue pattern and will probably purchase additional colors.	1
I have admired the workout leggings retailer sells since they debuted last year and i was excited when these went sale-on-sale. they're very cute and definitely true to size. i was worried the white made me look big, but with a longish shirt it's fine. also, they aren't made from the most athletic fabric - i think if i sweat in them too much they'd get icky fast. i don't sweat that crazy from my legs though so i expect they'll be fine!	1
I tried this on in the navy/white combination and loved it, except it is cut rather full or large through the waist especially. if you can size it down so it fits you, you will love it. it is very soft; an easy top to throw on, feel comfy, and look fantastic! i sure wish it was smaller :/	1
I really love these pants. just the right fabric, not too thick. so comfy. i do feel they run a bit big. they stretch out quickly so if you are in between sized, choose the smaller one.	1
I noticed a xxs p at the store. i thought they would never fit me since i am an xs, but i decided to try for fun and to my surprise they fit perfectly. i love it! very stylish and flattering.	1
"I anticipated receiving this skirt as i love a longer pencil skirt and this looks beautiful. i opened it, tried it on, sent it back...it is well made but has too many negatives. first, it is very thick. i ordered size 6 (5'2"", 140 lbs.). the size was good, but it is so thick that it adds lots of extra fluff around the waist and abdomen. it is also very stretchy and fits in an unflattering way. finally, and most importantly, it has a back and front vent and both are vented all the way up to the c"	0
Gorgeous! purchased in red; color is glowing if you have warm complexion/cool undertones.	1
This jacket is really pretty and unique. unfortunately the material around the waist area does not lay flat like it does in the picture. i'm 5 ft 6 in and a size 6. i ordered the medium. it fit well but the material around the waist area jutted out making me look really wide. disappointed to have to return this.	1
This cover up is precious. i ordered both sizes because i was unsure of how either would fit since there was only a s/m and m/l. there is not a whole lot of variation between the two. i wear a size 10 pants and the s/m fit, but i may still keep the m/l instead for fear that it may shrink when washed. the garment is hand wash only which i will do because of the delicacy of the tassels. that's a little high maintenance for a cover up but i am willing to do it because it really is a cute cover up.	1
"I saw this online and ended up driving over an hour to pick it up from a neighboring retailer store that had 1 more left in my size! it fits true to size for me with the waist band fitting my 27"" inches perfectly with no real give- so keep that in mind. the top does seem a little blousey, which i typically avoid (34d already) but this was still super flattering. overall it is a gorgeous dress that looks good on- one of those dresses that makes you feel good wearing it!"	1
"I ordered a 6 and it fit great i am 5ft 3"" and 130lbs 34b in the chest! i love the fabric, i was drawn to it because i don't think it will wrinkle and crease as easily as other fabrics. it is a flattering cut and is very beautiful in person. the embroidery makes the dress unique."	1
I kept this one because it was different enough and good to wear casually and to work. i'm not sure how this material will hold up with washing, since it's basically a thin cotton material. it fits perfectly, so i'm worried that it will shrink. i give it a thumbs up for the design, but sale cost and material is like something you would find at forever 21.	1
This sweater is so soft and comfortable. looks dressy with skirt and booties or casual with leggings and flats.	1
I don't buy many jackets (retired) but i think they are still useful. i had my doubts about this jacket -- like could they really get the trim straight at this price? but they did. the jacket is casual but sophisticated. i got the grey and the color is just as pictured. i will probably wear with dark jeans and i see several creative mashups with things in my closet. i am pleased and i think you will be too!	1
The sizing and length are great had it not been for my chest area. i sized up from my usual medium but the pleats create a maternity look for me unfortunately. it truly is a great tank top!	1
I love this dress which for me will double as tunic over leggings/tights. the fabric is very comfortable for fall into winter for southern california and looks super cute with booties or boots. this will be a mainstay of my wardrobe.	1
This tunic is perfect from the waist up. the problems comes in with the pockets. they make the tunic bulky around the hips and who needs bulk there? the tunic is a little more gray in person than what it appears to be in the photo. i usually wear an 8 or a medium. ordered this tunic in a medium and i think it runs just a little big. i may try this in a small. if that doesn't work, i may consider having the pockets removed in the medium. just wish is wasn't so pricey for all the extra work. but i	1
I bought the purple motif in size medium, my regular retailer size. the fit is true to size. the knit is soft and comfortable. this top can be dressed up or worn casually. it is a great all-around basic top for summer.	1
Loved this top, but had to return it. the collar is gorgeous but terrible quality	0
Love this top! i tried it on in the store and instantly loved. i wore it and ordered it in another color. i bought my usual size but decided i'd like to have it slightly smaller for the next one, so i ordered down. it can go either way, it's quite flawy and roomy. cool for summer and supper flattering.	1
I received this skirt today and was very disappointed. i don't know what i expected but it is not as i thought. even though the quality is very good and the fit is true to size, i may return it. the fabric of the skirt is just too busy, at least for me. i am just uncertain and even though i have many tops, the colors are just not matching. white looks better than any colored top with this particular print. i am going to try it on one more time and make a definite decision.	0
Purchased to speak at an event. not only is it very eye catching and i garnered many compliments it fit like it was made for me and was comfortable to wear. i questioned ordering a 4 and possibly could have worn a 6 but with the elasticity to the material there was no problem with movement or sitting and i felt hugged in in all the right places!	1
I tried this on at the store in the regular size it came in and thought maybe it has some potential is i ordered it for me in a petite since that's what i am. i ignored the package when i first got it thinking it wouldn't really look right but omg, it's 100% amazing and flattering. wear it with skinny jeans, leggings, jeggings, whatever and it's just super awesome on dressed up or down. i'd buy this over and over again without a doubt.	1
I ordered the neutral one with the fine stripe. it will layer nicely with neutral colored sweaters and blazers. the fabric is soft. the quality is good. the neck is cool that you can wear it two ways. overall, it is a good top. i think it's a little clingy, which highlights every flaw, in the back especially. i wouldn't size up. i still think it fits tts.	1
I saw this online and wasnt sure and actually walked right past it in the store. but my usual stylist walked around the store with me and insisted it was a goodone. she usually knows what she is talking about... super soft nd comfortable, love the long sleeves (it has hidden buttons), cut is flattering on everyone. i ended up ordering petite size. turtleneck is not too tight, and the dress can pretty mjuch be dressed up or down. my friend also bought it (huhm twinsies)!! my favorite design was t	1
This top runs very large. i am a size 12/14 & purchased the size l. i could have easily fit in the size m. it's a pretty top in a comfortable knit fabric , but the size was overwhelming so i returned it.	0
I loved this dress...until i washed it. the label says machine wash cold and lay flat to dry...which i did (washed on delicate). now it's not the same dress. it's too short and not as soft and i feel so much differently about it. i wish the label would just instruct to dry clean, i would pay the extra expense to still have the dress i loved. just kind of annoyed. so it's an awesome dress, just be prepared to dry clean it or risk shrinkage if you wash it.	1
Very slimming, lovely dress. a nice addition to your fall/ winter wardrobe. the embroidery is lovely, fabric soft and comfortable. sized perfectly.  so happy with this beautiful black dress!!!	1
This top is very cute...on other people. i ordered my normal size (xs) and just did not work out. it's very billowy on the bottom (too much for me) and the top portion did not lay right. the material is thin so you will need to wear a cami underneath it. perhaps if i got the petite xs that right have been a better fit...not sure. in the end the top went back.	1
Unlike the other two reviews , i found this dress horrid. i ordered a xs since i am between that and a s. it was just too much fabric for me. . i have a small frame, so it was just so overwhelming, the armholes were big and i felt like i had a bag on me. colors were nice and fabric was soft and light.. the belt made no sense as others have said. length was good. i tried it on as soon as i got it and couldn't take it off fast enough. i literally ran to the post office and back it goes. this is my	0
This is gorgeous! i absolutely love it but i need to return it. this is the second time i've ordered this dress/tunic. the fit is amazing, the fabric is so soft and it looks so fabulous on. the issue that i've had twice is that the back of the dress was not cut in the same direction. this means the sheen is different on one side of the middle seam in the back than the other side. unfortunately, it looks like 2 different colors. i returned the first one and i reordered but i have the same thing a	1
Very soft, cozy, and exactly what is needed on tbose in-between days. the collar is a bit dramatic if you are petite, but there is an extra button that makes it more manageable. stylish, cute	1
I am a huge fan of pilcro pants, and was so excited to see them make a pair of vegan leather pants. the idea is great - leather in the front, fully stretchy fabric in the back to give a fitted but comfortable look. however, i couldn't get past the way the seams and leather felt on my knees - really stiff and uncomfortable when you start walking around (can't bend the leg all the way; weird creasing and bunching behind the knee). the fit was perfect everywhere else. sadly, these had to go back :(	0
I ordered this top on sale and so glad that i did. i am usually a small in tops, but had read that it runs small. i went with a medium and wish that i picked the small. it is definitely a swing top. it's best feature is the detailing; it's gorgeous. i paired it with jeans and a white denim jacket.	1
The fabric is very light weight, more of a shirting material.  this surprised me because the dark flowers almost looked like flocked velvet in the picture.  the flowers are actually printed on cotton that has woven stripes.  it is so soft and light!  there is also a little webbing detail in the front yoke but nothing shows because there is a simple sewn in lining.  the skirt is not lined but the hem is weighted with a trim so that the skirt will hang right.  very flattering.  it does run big tho	1
I feel slim and comfortable in these cute trousers.  got compliments at work.   they are definitely more of a work pant, due to the material.  i think i could wear them outside of work (look-wise), but maybe wouldn't feel as comfortable in them after the hours of nine-to-five, due to the material.	1
Such a cute skirt. it has a touch of whimsy with this tropical flare that makes me feel pretty. it fits well and it is true to size.	1
I ordered the black and white shirt thinking it was polka dots, but turned out to be stars instead which was even cuter. fits true to size and is very soft and comfortable. my first thought after trying it on was that i should have ordered another one!	1
"Love tiny. i am 5'7"", 125-128 lbs depending on the day, and a 34a. i also have a very long torso, and tiny shirts are one of the few brands that are usually long enough for me. this one, however, was a huge miss. i ordered online in my usual tiny xs. it was much too big around and felt shorter in the front than stated, so it looked boxy on me. however, the worst part was the placket. the description doesn't note that it's held together with a tiny snap. that snap takes nothing to undo, and then"	0
This is a beautiful dress with so many interesting textures and colors. it is form-fitting yet modest enough to wear for so many occasions - i plan to wear it for my son's graduation, but i think there are many potential uses for this dress. be aware that, like many byron lars sheath dresses, the bottom part is very tight- makes it hard to fit for more pear-shaped people. the top is a tad loose on me while the bottom is quite snug. however if i go up or down a size it will be too big on top or t	1
Do not buy these pants!  the first time i washed these pants i ended up with big faded spots, and i followed the washing instructions.  i bought another pair and the same thing happened.  i'm out a bunch of money!	0
"After reading other people's reviews, i was afraid it might be too long. i ordered the regular xs as all the petite a were sold out. i found the length to be perfect and i am only 5'2""."	1
This skirt makes me look at least a size smaller. i love it! the sa was wearing it in the store and it liked great on her as well with just a plain white top. tts- got my usual 10 in green.	1
"This picture does not do this skirt justice. it is gorgeous. however, the waist was so small that the sequins dug into my waist making me think of a medieval torture device. unfortunately, it was the largest size so i can't size up. i'm 4'11"" so the length was perfect - it came to right above my knees. i love the skirt so much that i'm considering liposuction."	1
The skirt is totally see through unless you wear a slip. even though it has a built in slip, it is still see through. the problem is that the slip is made out of the same super thin polyester material as the outside skirt. if it wasn't see through i would keep it.	0
This sweatshirt is extremely comfy and stylish. i am happy with the item and it runs a snag large but perfect for a sweatshirt.	1
This kimono is beautiful! pictures definitely do not do it justice! i love the details of the beading and sequins throughout. the only downfall is that they can snag and get fall off quite easily. delicate but still my fav kimono ever.	1
Love this sweater! i have it in the raspberry and the charcoal color. it's so soft and comfortable. looks great with jeans or leggings. it's casual but you can dress it up a bit and you still looked polished. it's a little oversized. only downfall is that it piles easily.	1
Has anyone tried to hand wash this dress instead of dryclean? runs a little large. i am 5'5 135# 34dd and purchased xs. i was really surprised that xs fits well. i initially tried small but the armholes were too big. the waist is a little too high but i plan to wear it with a belt.	1
"I have been watching this dress online since it arrived, finally decided to order it online. it is as great in person as it looks on the website. the fabric, cut and finishing of the dress are high quality and my usual size 10 fits great. it falls about 3"" above the knee on my 5'5"" frame which is a little short for the office, but i could do it on a friday with a cardigan. the fit is comfortable and flattering for a gal with broad shoulders and small curves. when i tried it on friends raved. thi"	1
I bought this to use over the holidays. it is extremely comfortable and i've received multiple complements. you can dress it up or wear it casual.	1
Very unique shirt-- you will get a compliment! the material has a great feel and weight. beautiful color. it runs true to size.	1
"So, i'm really surprised that reviewers said the fit was too small and too tight in the arms. i'm 5'7"" and 183lbs and my husband (god bless his soul) bought me an 8 for my birthday. i tried it on just to see and was pretty impressed i could button it across my chest and get it over my arms as those are common problem areas for me. regardless i need to exchange the shirt for a larger size because even though i got it on its not how is supposed to look. the shirt is loose around the midsection whi"	1
Color is beautiful, fits perfectly, lace is lovely and cut is feminine and flattering. hoping to top with a sweater so i can wear it longer in the season.	1
"This reminds me of a kimono or poncho rather than a ""cardigan"" but that aside its a beautiful sweater. the feel of it is luxurious and is soft and comfortable. i would size down at least one size. i'm usually a medium to large and i bought the small. i gave this piece 4 stars because it is a touch boxy. it's seems like a piece i'll throw on with jeans and wear to a casual dinner in the fall. definitely a fall/winter item."	1
Ordered the shirt online. beautiful print and good quality material. runs very large - size down 1 may be 2 sizes as the material on the body is very wide. i will be exchanging it in the store.	1
This coat is beautifully made and for $800 i expect no less. however, i should have checked other resources prior to buying. the color on this website is nothing like actual color of coat. i was expecting a nice dark red/wine as depicted on these photos. however, it is a bright magenta/dark fuscia more on the purpleish side that does not go so much with my wardrobe (even though i am a pink-loving person haha). i had hoped to pair it with the same skirt shown here and the peony sweater that was i	1
I love this top! fits great n is elegant. great for the workplace n a night out. absolutely beautiful! quality fabric. love love love!	1
Pilcro is an incredible denim brand and i've never been disappointed. these are no exception. minimal distress, perfect length (i'm 5'8 and they hit just like the model), great color and super comfy! they have some stretch to them and definitely fit baggier, so depending on how you want them to fit...i sized down for a snugger fit. these are fantastic!	1
I usually wear either an xs or a small and i went with the small because i wanted it flowy and long because i am 5'9. it is a great fit, but it is a little sheer. i will probably have to wear a cami underneath.	1
This product is awesome! i'm a tall lady with wide calves and thighs and these socks look and feel fantastic on me; they are tight enough that they don't wind up sliding down around my ankles, but not so snug that they make my legs look like sausages. i would recommend this product to all of my girlfriends.	1
I was so excited about this top, as the picture of the model it looks beautiful and drapey in just the right way. unfortunately, this top feels like an old grandma's polyester suit, the sides are much shorter than the front & back and the combo of the inner lining and the outer fabric feels awkward with the inner piece being significantly shorter the the outer. it also puffed out a bit at the top of the shoulders in a strange way, due to the layered fabric.  sadly, going back.	0
"I am 5'7"" and wanted a swing type of dress that wasn't too short to be too young or too long to look frumpy and this fits perfect. it's very comfortable. it has nice quality in the fabric... not all polyester like many of the swing dresses out now.  it's a bit longer in the back and has a very ethereal quality without being childlike. it's pretty, the sleeves are long enough and the elastic fits well. no pinching. i can wear a full bra with it and both boots and super sexy heels look great wi"	1
I was so in love with these when i saw them online. they arrived today, and while the fit was great, i was disappointed. the colors are definitely more drab in person than what's pictured in the photo. the material is very thick. it's soft and they'd be warm in cold weather, i'm sure. i liked them, but they were underwhelming. if they were less expensive, i would probably keep them because i liked the fit and they'd be a quirky alternative to what i usually wear to work, but sadly, back they go.	0
Have kept my eyes out for a jacket like this for several years now. and this one is more than i had hoped for.  in the store i was between a l and m.  so went with the large.  after getting home and trying on a couple more times i decided to order the petite large.  jacket is roomy warm and so so soft.  added bonus w the hood.	1
I had such high hopes for this top! the colors! the peplum! the ruffles! the price point! the fit was terrible, unflattering, and laughable! please try again with this one, retailer. you could have a real winner with a little tweaking!	0
This is one of the best things i have ever bought from anrtho. it is very flattering, and i always get compliments when i wear it. must have!	1
The fit is a little bit odd, it is short and wide, too much fabric. the quality is not good, the buttons can easily break and the stitching was falling apart. i am returning it.	0
Lovely feel to this almost-cowl neck turtleneck. it's quite thin, and has 3/4 length sleeves, so it won't keep you warm. but the fabric is soft, the ribbing is flattering, and the fit is loose without feeling frumpy. overall, a good staple that's a bit more interesting. the mauve-ish color looks great with grays.	1
Absolutely love this shirt - the embroidery on the front is beautiful. gold and silver metallic thread with good quality. very slim fit through the torso with loose sleeves. the only downside is the cream material is very sheer - definitely have to wear a tank underneath.	1
Runs huge! returning the m for a s; normally a m top and s bottom in sizing. very soft, wonderful colour.	1
Like these pants and they were on sale--does not get better!	1
If you're pregnant, congratulations. this shirt is for you. if you've ever dreamed of being an xxs, this shirt is also for you. i'm a 34d, normally a small or medium, but often size down to xs in swing tops. the xs is ginormous on me, although it fits through the shoulders. i can hold onto the bottom and stretch my arms straight out at the sides, it's that wide. think flying squirrel. what doesn't show in the pictures is that it also has a slight dolman sleeve, which makes it look wide at the to	0
I love the paisley print, very soft and comfy, flutter sleeve look is cute,perfect weekend wear.	1
These are nice, comfortable summer pants that travel well. the material has a nice feel to it,lightweight, but not too thin. they are easy to wear with any summer top, and look just dressy enough. i like the elastic waist, but the pants will stretch out a bit, and run a little large.	1
To be honest, i bought this dress as a ride-along so i would meet a free shipping minimum in order to purchase the dress i really wanted. i wound up keeping this dress and returning the one i originally wanted. it's pretty, flowy, feminine. i even like the uneven-ish hemline, which normally doesn't appeal to me. it runs a bit large--you might want to size down. i got it in the black and tan...even though it's got short sleeves and is sort of summery, it will make a good transition piece to fall	1
Great quality, flattering cut- could even be used as a little day dress for warm weather! love the detail of the buttons on the back and the delicacy of the straps.	1
I ordered both colors in size xl and they're each now favorite purchases. the fit is true to size--it matches the photos. the orange/white/brown/red combo works great with the orange version of the indra tassel necklace. the tops are sheer so i wear a tank underneath. the green floral version will have some variations because of pattern placement. both are so unique & charming! i've been pairing them with different retailer cardigans & necklaces. they've washed well too--in a mesh bag on gentle &	1
Did not even know this is available in petite! as someone who is at 5' exaggerated, there regular size xs/s fits nicely. great find. goes well with leggings or jeans. this will be a wardrobe staple for quite a while.	1
I made the mistake of ordering without checking the reviews. cute design but not as comfy as it looks. returned immediately.	0
I bought this in rose and i really like the jacket. the color is not rose but the picture is accurate. it is more terra cotta as previous reviewer's said. it is pretty casual but you can dress it up with a chunky necklace and dressy boots. i do wish it was a tad more fitted in the waist. i think it looks better buttoned, but i do wear it open as well.	1
Like others, i finally received my size 6p black pants after months of waiting.  for starters, these pants run small, so i ordered a size up but still in petite, because i adored the red ones i got this past summer.  when the black pants arrived, they were a full three inches shorter than the red ones (which were also 6p), and the fabric did not feel anywhere close to the same quality.  i'm debating ordering the regular length, but i'm not sure i'll bother, based on some of the other reviews.	0
This is a beautiful knit dress, however it runs large, so be wary. for reference i am a 34d, 28 inch waist, and 41 inch hips. i ordered a medium because dresses usually run tight around my bum, and it was very, very big. i'm hoping the small is much more flattering because the quality of the knit is very nice.	1
I bought this dress for a wedding i have this summer, and it's so cute. unfortunately the fit isn't perfect. the medium fits my waist perfectly, but was way too long and too big in the bust and shoulders. if i wanted to spend the money, i could get it tailored, but i just felt like it might not be worth it. side note - this dress was delivered to me with a nordstrom tag on it and i found it much cheaper there after looking!	1
This is the weirdest, greatest material. it feels as soft and as buttery as leather, but doesn't look like leather. it looks more like coated denim. only lighter. and stretchy. so you don't get the vibe you get from the vast majority of vegan leather--thick, rubbery junk trying to masquerade as the real thing. also gorgeous: the cut. it's straight and slim, but with pleats so hip-less ladies like me look like we have some shape. i got my regular size, and they fit beautifully, but they are not	1
Love this top! i'm 5'7, 145 pounds, athletic build, and the medium falls slightly loosely and very nicely over my hips. it is quite low cut, so i wear a tank under it in a professional environment, but it's fine to wear sans tank top in a more casual setting. i really love the back, as the straps are sexy and show off my shoulders. the material seems to be good quality, and i would order this in more colors if it were available!	1
"I find it very difficult to find office friendly yet unique designs and feel this one fits the bill and also has the ability to be dressed up for the evening. i am ""curvy on bottom"" so i sized up from my normal retailer 4 to a 6 and surprisingly the dress fit my hips just fine. i'm 5'8"" 140 about 36-27-36 if it helps as i know it's hard to determine sometimes if this style will fit a more curvy figure...my advice is to go up a size if you are. the fabric i found true to the photo and the emerald i"	1
"This top is a great, versatile long sleeved shirt. i'm 5'10"" and the sleeves were long for me, so i don't know why it's listed as 3/4 length. i could see where sleeve length would be a problem for more petite ladies. the wine color is beautiful. it is slightly more fitted than the picture, i was afraid it might be semi-sheer, but its totally fine. i wish it was a bit longer in the torso, but it's not short like some sweaters this season. i do tend to have a shorter torso, so a tall lady with a l"	1
I love this dress so much i bought it in 2 colors, it's so soft and cozy, i want to live in it!	1
The quality of this jacket is outstanding. color combination is very chic and sophisticated. jacket is warm but not bulky.	1
I usually wear a small, 4 or 6 and in this dress i couldn't even zip up the 8. so tight in the rib cage and chest. if i tried to go up even further the bottom half got much bigger. guess this one is not for me.	0
I spend a lot of time on the retailer website. it never occurred to me to try this dress. a salesperson suggested it in the store and i tried it on. it is really cute on. i bought a thrift store denim jacket to throw over it. the only con is the sleeves. i am 5'3' and my arms are not very long. the bell sleeves are a little crazy on me, but they will be hidden under the jacket.	1
This dress is true to size, it looks sexy on the model but much more modest in person. great for work!	1
"This dress is very striking, especially in the green color way i purchased. flow and loose, very feminine but not ""cute"". well made and very much in style this season. i returned it because it wasn't quite suitable for me-1 size up would have been a better. fit overall."	1
Haven't worn it yet, but i am loving this top. it is much prettier in person. i sized up to a med based on reviews and it looks like it runs small. i didn't try it on until i got home and probably could have done ok in a small but will keep the medium so it's not tight across my chest. the knit material that makes up the arms and back is thin, which is my only complaint. if it was slightly thicker it would look nicer and i'm sure wear longer. i'm happy with my purchase-the colors, fabric, embroi	1
I ordered the chelan wrap coat in the beautiful red color. it's artsy and will be fun to wear with jeans and other casual clothing. it's super comfy and fits true to size.	1
Pic doesn't do it justice, very flattering. i got it in navy. definitely worth the sale price!	1
This dress has way too much material. the material is really soft and beautiful but there's too much of it. it feels like you're wearing a big sack. sadly i'll be returning it.	0
I wanted to fall in love with this jacket! i'm an xs or s in retailer brands so i ordered this online in both sizes. when i received it i felt the fabric and immediately loved the color and texture. creamy white (not too stark) and so incredibly soft! the length was the same as on the model which is what i wanted because being 5'2 113# many jackets swallow me. i have narrow shoulders and unfortunately this jacket was too broad and puffy for my frame, and i looked like a marshmallow. the xs was the	1
I wish i had read more of the reviews....but thought i would give it a try. the shirt doesn't seem as long as on the model but the armpits are sewn to hit mid shirt. this would be ok if it was the length pictured, but since it isn't it makes you look very boxy. i don't know if i ordered a size too big or if it is just the way the shirt was made. wanted to love for fall.....unfortunately, i am taking back.	0
I really like this sweater. i would suggest ordering a size up. i could had worn my normal size but a size up was much more comfortable. i have a burnt orange skirt that i wear with this and it makes the flowers pop.	1
If you can get over the fact that this skirt feels (and looks awfully similar to) the exact same fabric your drugstore halloween costumes had when you were a little kid... then, it's surprisingly fun to wear.	1
"The model must have this sweater pinned at the back. the sweater color is true and the material soft as anything, but the fit is ??!! at 5'9"" with a long torso and broad shoulders, the large was still shlumpy. didn't hang right at all, bunches oddly and is not the least bit flattering. my 5'7"" uber fit daughter had the same issue, and she usually makes everything that doesn't work for me look amazing. returned."	0
"Love these! the raw hem is on-trend! length is great (i'm 5'6""). material is the classic pilcro washed chinos. perfect. as with all pilcro pants, they stretch a bit. :)"	1
"I purchased the red color in august after seeing it in the store. it is cozy and stylish-love the coordinating pattern in the cowl neck. i am 5'7"" and 135 lbs and the s fit great. noticed that it is now on special promotion and would advise you purchase now! it is completely worth full price but if you can save and buy say a coordinating pilcro pant, all the better, right??"	1
Cute print got lots of compliments when i wore it. lightweight. looks great with boots	1
I love these pants! best fitting pants i've ever owned. flattering. stretchy/don't stretch out. i am so sad that retailer didn't plan well and stock enough. i bought the black, want the gray and all sizes but 25 and 31 are sold out. i might just buy another black pair so i can have another. i really wish retailer would re-stock these!!!! although these are 5star pants, i rated them a 3 for retailers poor / low stock quantity.	1
The fabric is nice and the color is a rich jewel-tone. i have a couple of very similar shirts from a similar store that are several years old. those fit a bit more loss sly around the stomach (not baggy, just body-skimming) which made them more flattering for more body types. this shirt works if you have a little padding because of the gathered folds, but it probably wouldn't be great for someone carrying a lot of extra weight around their middle. the knot also has a tendency to twist exposing t	1
Most often complimented item of this spring's wardrobe	1
When these shorts arrived i loved them and was so excited to wear them on my upcoming trip to the beach. the high rise waist is very flattering and the material was extremely soft. the floral detailing was a little more orange than in the picture but i still loved the contrast. the first time i wore these i immediately noticed threads coming loose throughout the day. it was minor but still concerning for an item that was so costly. the real problem arose in the evening when i put on a jacket on	0
I was on the fence about this cardigan. once i got it in the mail, it's cute! it will go great with a long tank or longer t-shirt. worth the sale price! i ordered a small and is true to size.	1
Reference: 100#, 5'1, 32a... ordered size xs.  the suit is pretty.  under the neckline, where the two orange panels meet the white center panel, that corner puckers a bit.  this will not happen if you have a larger chest than my 32a or have a longer/broader torso so that the fabric can stretch out, thus pulling that merging area flat.  the sides (cut out) lays flat when you stand up straight and gapes when your turn/bend to the side.  i think this is expected.  the bottom section, on the back, c	1
"Recently bought these on sale, though they were still a bit in the expensive side. i'm 5'2"" and typically a size 4, the xs fits perfectly. the pants fall to my ankle and are not cropped as they are on the model, but i'm fine with that. the piping on the seams helps them not seem too much like pajamas, and i was particularly pleased that the crotch was not too baggy, as sometimes happens with this style."	1
I love this, just bought it and so glad i did. really want to wear it out, so hopefully the weather will cool down soon since i am in the south and we are experiencing an extremely warm winter. regardless, it will be with me a long time...so if i don't use it this season, i will eventually as it is timeless and goes with anything.	1
"I'm 5""0"" and weigh 105 lbs. i purchased the xxs and it was super-wide, and big all over. it looked like a pregnancy top and did not lay as nicely as shown on the model. also, not shown on the model is the front is short and the back is very long. this would work better on a taller person. i just find it odd that a xxs is still too big. the quality of the fabric and the print is good and the lace-up in the back is cute."	0
Looked good in pictures. i even ordered an xxs petite and it was huge! although the sweater has interesting textures and is very beautiful, it is very awkward and poor fit. will be sending back.	0
"I am 5'8"", about 140, athletic build. i purchased this dress for business meetings and such. i was worried the dress was going to be too low cut but i  am small chested so i can wear lower cuts without exploding out of it. luckily this is the case here too! the dress has a professionally sexy look which i love. nice fabric, good quality. happy i bought it!"	1
This is a wonderful one-piece swim suit! it's very flattering on, and the colors and design are just lovely. i also love the suit's vintage feel and that it's sexy without being overly revealing. i seldom pay full price for clothing, but this item is definitely worth every penny!!! i bought a size medium and it fit perfectly.	1
The fit of these jeans are so great! they look syllish and feel great at the same time. this brand does a fabulous job of creating a jean that feels like you can wear them dressed up and casual. a+	1
"I know the photos for this dress show it as a very ""casual"" dress, but i find it very elegant.i really love this dress. it is very simple, but that is what makes it stunning. . the fabric is heavy enough to drape perfectly. it fits really nice on top - my bra fits just fine underneath and doesn't show. i'm a short gal and i will have to wear a small heel even though i purchased an xxs petite. i'm fine with that. nice quality, fits well - done deal for me!"	1
I have been looking for lace shorts for years. yes, years! finally found these shorts that are perfect. the lace is sturdy, not flimsy, so they are not see-through. i purchased both the cream and the blue when they went on sale. my skin is a bit tan, so lighter-colored clothing can be see-through for me. both colors are fantastic and i get compliments on them all the time, especially the blue shorts. plus, they complement either a t-shirt or a blouse. i love the eyelash fringe at the hem - such	1
These are so cute... i went into the store to buy something else and came out with these. i usually wear a 10 and bought a medium. these are also lower price than i expected. also, well constructed. thank you antho!!	1
Unfortunately this piece has a very boxy cut and the white layer is stiff and billows out - i am tall and thin but this made me look pregnant - very unflattering. i considered trying a smaller size, but i did not like the material too much either so i just returned it.	0
Cute skirt and print, but high waisted. also was more snug so think it runs a tad small. i wanted to tuck in a shirt like shown in picture, but it looks goofy because the waist is so high. also there is no flexibility there so size up if you want to wear it lower. the model's arms are covering her waist so hard to tell what proportion looks like on her. i'm 5'4 so might work better on a taller person. sending back.	1
I paid full price for this cardigan and have not regretted purchase for one minute, having worn it almost every day this summer.  it is the perfect weight for cool summer evenings, seaside strolls, chilly restaurants, or  for a sunblock layer when you have to be outside.	1
I have received so many compliments on this top from both men and women. it is so comfortable and cute, i never want to take it off. :p	1
This jumpsuit is all the things other reviewers have stated: roomy, flattering, has give. however, note: the way in and out of this outfit is a single button with a loop at the top of the back. if you need to run to the restroom - plan. it can be an absolute pain to get out of this outfit to go to the restroom. let's not talk about the possibilities of the outfit dropping on a public restroom floor...yes, i went there... i would have preferred separates to a single piece. you could achieve th	1
This dress fits really cute. i actually think it's cuter in person than on the site. really flattering. the skirt hits a few inches longer on me than it does on the model, so it's appropriate for work and networking functions. i'm 5'3, 110lbs. i got the 0 and it's great!	1
Super comfy, easy to put on, and super cute! you can dress it up and dress it down! i'm usually a size s and the small fits fine, but i think the xs would have fit better.	1
"This sweet little number in the mustard yellow has become my fall and winter ""go-to"" sweater. so easy to wear, understated and a bit retro. looks great tucked into skirts or high-waisted jeans, or out, and the subtle shift in textures is a nice detail. highly recommend, and a great price point!"	1
While i wouldn't normally look at this piece, the price was unbeatable. i was even more impressed when it arrived and i tried it on! the design is reminiscent of an old time patchwork quilt fairy tale- more beautiful in person than in the pic. the covered buttons at the neck and wrists are just lovely and feminine, and the dress falls and flows around me in a fun and flirty way. i paired it with charcoal heather tights and dark gray booties- super cute! you won't regret it.	1
I wanted to love this shirt. i like the style, the material is soft but it was so short on me. perhaps i just have a long torso but it fit everywhere else. i wasn't even able to tuck it in because the sides just were so short.	1
I have an hourglass shape, so this skirt is winner for me. classic a-line fit but with a modern hem. it's subtly shiny, very stylish, and comfortable. paired with a tight shirt and heels it looks extremely sexy. a sale price makes it all the sweeter.	1
Love everything about this top! comfortable yet classy, dress it up or down depending on occasion. beautiful design.	1
I purchased this in my usual small (size 4-6) and it fits just the way it shows in the photo. it is very flowy which is th point. i wore it over a black romper and it looked great. i can also wear with jeans and a simple black tank. keep the vest open or use the hook and eye and close it up. seeing the black through the sheer white is simply dreamy! glad i purchased it during the sale on sale promotion. it is a classic piece for sure.	1
These jeans are great quality, but they just hit too low for me to be comfortable.	1
This is a great dress; good quality fabric. the pattern & color are spot on. the silhouette is divine & would work on many body types. i also love the length!	1
I had never worn pilcro jeans, and i took a chance and ordered without trying them on. i couldn't be more pleased! i wear a 26, but it is often difficult to find a good fitting pair of jeans. these fit comfortably and don't feel too tight, but are fitted enough to look great. i like the little bit of extra room around the top, allowing the jeans to feel comfortable. i'll be back for more pilcro jeans!	1
I love this blouse, it looks great under a blazer dressed up and great with boyfriend jeans. it is loose and flowy, the neck line is low. i bought a medium and it is a little large but fits with the style of the top. i happen to love the fabric, it is soft and feels great on the skin. one of my favorite fabric combinations is rayon (viscose) and cotton.	1
I absolutely love this skirt! i feel like the color works well for most seasons: you can pair it with a light tee or tank top and some sandals during warmer months, or layer it with a sweater, thick tights and boots in autumn. really nice staple piece for your wardrobe. i do think it runs a bit large: i generally wear a 6 (depending on the brand and style), but this 6 was way too large around my waist by at least a couple inches. i returned it and got a 4, which fit me perfectly. it's nice that	1
I was really suprised when i received this top. it was a knit (more like a t-shirt material), which i really like. this way you can wear casual as well as dressing it up. it is not see thru at all and it stay off the shoulder. the one thing i dont like is the elastic band at top is too wide. but overall ita s keeper!	1
"Rarely do i find tops that fit similar to the model in the picture. my body type is no comparison. i am 5'5"" and about 170# with 30"" waist. this sweater in a large fit perfectly where the back lining and ruffle fell right at the top of my bottom which was very flattering. not to short and not long over bottom. just right. bought in cream and wish i would have bought in both colors..........."	1
I tried on the xs in store (would need xxs i think, it is short enough to not need petite). anyway, the neck part was really bunching up on me (between neck and girls), it wasn't flattering. the rest of the tank is really pretty and flattering though, but the bunching was enough for me to leave it behind. the fabric is soft, and the color is nice warm neutral. i love the lace back with the subtle layer of satiny looking fabric. overall goo, perhaps i don't have the right shoulder shape fr this.	1
I adored this when i saw it online, paired with the leather skirt. i waisted impatiently for it to show up and, when it did, was happy at the price point but unsure of how it would feel. for the cut, i would say it runs tts. i am sometimes an xxs but in this case that size was tight across the shoulders. i am worried that the xs will be too roomy in the waist but time will tell. as for quality, well, you can feel the polyester in it, for sure. it's nice to have the lining, but i would not say it	1
"I bought this sweater online as soon as i saw it. but like the other reviewers i agree it is shapeless and sticks out too much at and below the waist. if it were a softer fabric maybe the flair would work but not for this one. i am 5' 2"", 115lbs, 32d and got the xs. maybe if you aren't chesty it won't flare out as much. sadly i had to return it. i was so excited for it, o well."	0
My favorite white blouse ever. i was hesitant, but really love it. it makes me think of summer, flowers, paris.... it's so soft and comfortable. yes, the cut is different and took a moment to get used to... but i like that. and it looks better on. imo. i can see this getting worn a lot on hot summer southern days. i've been on a hunt for a great white blouse for a long time. tres chic!	1
I ordered this shirt in the grey/blue color choice; the creamy grey is perfectly heathered and the blue silk-like bottom is a classy touch. the fit of this shirt in the arms, torso, and back was flattering with a little room to drape. love it!	1
I have to agree with another poster who was dissapointed about the dress not being lined....i mean, any dress over $50 should at least be lined! but, overall this is an adorable dress, very flattering and so fun for summer! if it were lined i would have purchased, but that's all personal preference as i cannot stand having to wear a slip!	1
Super soft, super comfy pants. pain in the butt to iron out the wrinkles they came with.	1
"This dress is adorable. it's easy to wear, really comfortable and i think looks great on. i'm 5'4"", i probably should have gotten a petite - the shortest part of the dress meets my knees. the fabric is quite soft, flows like jersey - it does seem to be a little cheaper and i can't speak to durability yet...hoping it holds up!"	1
So thin and see thru it's not even wearable in public. extremely cheap and ill fitting for any price let alone this price. i feel like they will rip the moment i wear them out. going back.	0
Pretty and with pockets! also, nice quality for the price. interesting texture.	1
I purchased this sock in another print before and wear them all the time. i was happy to see a new pair on the website and purchased them again! these liner socks actually stay on my feet... others brands i've tried before slip off my heel, but these stay hidden and stay put. plus a fun design!	1
This is a great, versatile everyday tee. the fit is flattering, and the material is soft and lightweight. this, like many retailer tops, runs large under the arms. i first tried the medium, and although i liked the way the tee hung, it gapped in my underarms. there was no small in my store, so i tried on the xs. it still hung nicely, and no underarm gap. love the simple colors - denim blue and gray is a great combination. liked it enough to pay full price:)	1
The petite was a little bit long on me (i'm 5'2), but it otherwise fits true to size and is very soft and comfortable, breezy. covers enough that it is work appropriate or for something outside. a keeper!	1
"How can some reviewers say this jacket is true to size, yet others say it runs small? i think it's because this jacket is cropped. by the time i took advantage of the fall perks 20 percent discount, the xs peach was sold out so i ended up ordering size s. i also got the xs gray to compare. sure enough, the xs looks better but is cropped on me. for ref, i'm 5' 5"", 32a, 115 lbs. i don't really need another almost black jacket so i'm either sized out or have to exchange for xs peach to wear with dr"	1
Very flattering dress in a comfortable material. the cut is perfectly placed. this is very long. i'm 5'11 and in flats this touches the floor. easily dressed up or down with the tight accessories.	1
Adorable summer top. the geometrical shape makes this top interesting. it looks much better on then in the picture displayed. it's soft , flowing and covers all flaws. the gold color is beautiful and vibrant. i know i will purchase this in other colors. the long back really sets it off. if you are looking for comfort, don't hesitate, this top is perfect.	1
The color and quality of this sweater are fantastic. the reason i only gave it two stars is that the height of the neck didn't seem right to me. it looked awkward and too high to be left standing upright, but when folded over i wished it were higher so it formed more of a turtleneck/cowl. i will be returning the sweater because of that.	0
"This top came down to my hip bones, but i am short-waisted. the shirt definitely fits shorter than in the photo. the measurements listed for ""regular"" seem to be a bit shorter than the 26"" l measurement i got when i measured it. i think the quality is nice, and though it could likely easily snag if you're not one who is used to wearing delicate clothing, i didn't find this top to be flimsy at all. for reference i purchased a l and the fit is more form-fitting on me than it is on the model, but n"	1
This top is fun to wear & looks great with black, grey or my wine color jeans!! love it!	1
I love this dress! it is equally pretty in person too. sometimes i will order things and when i get them the colors are totally different than what i anticipated. not with this dress. i love it and will get a lot of use out of it over the spring/summer.	1
I love this bralette. i have it in other colors as well and it is always the one i go to when i want comfort.	1
I am torn about this dress. the print is very pretty and the fabric has a gentle flow to it. the top part is great but the portion below the chest reminded me of a tent. it is tricky to pull off if you are well-endowed on the top or wear a padded bra. i liked the look better when i tied it at the back with the ultra-thin belt straps which gave some shape to the waist. i agree with the other reviewer that a slim person could carry the look well. i usually don't return online purchases unless they	1
I was so excited to get this top..but it's boxy and a little itchy from the design. i just didn't think it was worth the hefty price. i'm normally a small in retailer clothing	0
The top was very small. i am usually a size small but this was tight around the top, arm holes and it was short. also i didn't notice if it said it was sheer ( see through) in the description but it definitely requires another shirt underneath.	0
These shorts are super soft and comfortable. i am normally a size 27 or a 2 in shorts. i got a size 26 in these shorts and they are still large. i exchanged them for a 25 and they fit perfectly. so these run 1-2 sizes large. other than sizing, these shorts are perfectly comfortable and functional.	1
I bought this to wear in the warm climates, when you go indoors it is always freezing. i also travel a lot and wanted something light weight to wear on the plane and airport. wore it the first day all day with jeans and top. lots of compliments. i was worried that driving in the car, it would get torn or snagged. didn't! loved it so much, going to by another one similar and have on again!	1
3 tags - one quite huge (about 2'' by 3'') - very itchy. so i cut out the tags and they are sewn with some kind of hard poky plasticy thread - now even more itchy! i will have to wear these inside out.	0
This is a great shirt but it was big for its size. i'm also short so maybe the petite size would have fit me better	1
I love, love, love this top! the cutout pattern in front is such a unique look and is a great way to add some fun to your usual t-shirt and jeans look. it's well made and the fit is great. i got it in petite s which worked great length-wise.	1
Pretty disappointed in this sweater. should have sized down because it's quite wide. i also didn't like the stair step. the back clung to my rear. not attractive. the colors seemed to be striking online but in reality are not. returning mine.	0
"And the bottom looks like a tutu. first, i have high tolerance for scratchy fabric but this one i could feel it even through long sleeves. there is no way i could wear something that makes my skin itch so badly. second, the peplum part is huge and looks like an exaggerated skirt. finally, the color on the ""green one"" is darker than in the picture and it does have more of a green than blue tint. back it goes."	0
I loved this dress and after i got it on. as others mentioned, it is difficult to get it on. i wish that the bow snapped on and off. as i took the dress off the bow came off itself. unfortunately going to be returning the dress.	0
Exactly what i needed post pregnancy. this top is very comfortable with a drape that hides my tummy. the back hits that perfect spot where it looks great, but still hides a normal bra.	1
Love this skirt... perfect length and cut! pilcro, make more of these!!!! i ordered up so that it hug more on my hips than waist, just prefer that better, but i think if you can pull of the waist look, go for it! would buy more in different colors!	1
This dress hangs like a sack. it really needs a belt to give it some shape. i tried to style it with one, but then didn't look right either. i did like the slip that came with it. i'll be returning it.	0
I have another sanctuary vest similar to this one and decided i needed to snag this one in the moss green. it's so pretty and it's extremely versatile. i'm 8 months pregnant and it's been a fun vest to wear over a tank with a necklace. i can see this piece working for all seasons. if the other color would have been available, i would have grabbed it, especially at the sale price. you can't beat it! the only downside to this vest is that compared to my other medium sanctuary vest, this one is a b	1
I saw this dress online and i ordered immediately! it has everything i love: my fav color, a peplum and feminine cut out details. i ordered my usual size medium, and it was too tight in the chest, and i am just average... 34c. loved it so reordered in a size large. if you are thinking of purchasing this beauty i would suggest going up a size if you are on the upper end of your size (medium 8/10 and i am usually a 10 so needed to go up) the reason i gave the quality a lower rating is that the med	1
I love this suit! the fit is incredible.  i'm unsure that the fabric will stand the test of time, but i got it on sale, and i don't know about you ladies but ill do anything for a great suit!	1
Many thanks to all previous reviewers that convinced me to try this blazer. i bought it in navy and it is absolutely perfect. i love its simple lines, softness, and quality of the material. it transitions easily from work to casual. i paired it with mirabella lace top and skinny jeans for a look that is both practical and beautiful.	1
This dress was so comfortable, i wore it all day - to church, out to brunch and actually slept in it. it would travel well, too.	1
This henley has a lot of very nice details (lace, embroidery). the material is soft and a little bit sheer (more so in the lacey sections). it is made in india and the style strikes me as a bit indian looking. the only thing i do not like is that there are two buttons along the v shape decolltage..but there are no button holes on the other side so they are purely for decoration (you can see those buttons in the enlarged detail view only). this irks me a bit, because i would like to button the sh	1
I bought this in store on sale and absolutely love it.	1
I'm very glad i snatched this up when i did. it is super soft and the perfect length. i love the slight peplum as it makes for a very flattering fit. i can tell this shirt will be a staple year round as it works great with shorts or jeans. for me, i think the large was a tiny bit big in the waist, but it might shrink in the wash. the armholes were nice too, and didn't gap.	1
New fav lbd. i am 5 months postpartum and this dress makes me feel like my old self again. it fits right above the waist, with a bow to cinch the waist. love the fit and flare. the top is warm, great for a cold evening out. and the taffeta really dresses it up. love	1
"I love the look and quality of this shirt, but far too large!! i got a large because i prefer roomy shirts, but this will go back. i may get a small. for reference i'm 150, 5'4""."	1
"This dress is a winner, i'm baffled that there is only one review? i thought this was a dolan dress. the material is soft and substantial. the cut and style hides figure flaws without adding bulk. this versatile dress is perfect for all seasons and all social situations. i'm 5'3"" 135# 38/28/35 and purchased size m."	1
Tried this on in the store, very soft and hangs well, better on, than the hanger. needless to say i bought it!	1
I bought this dress for an awards ceremony, and couldn't be more pleased. the quality and detailing on the dress are great, and the hidden side zipper makes the dress easy to put on. i love that it's machine washable on a delicate setting. i've already worn it twice, and can't wait to wear it again for easter.	1
This dress is so flattering, not the usual type of dress i go for, but decided on a whim to try and am glad so glad i did. the material has enough heft to give you a beautiful silhouette without being too clingy. you can dress up or down, if you don;t like showing too much cleavage you may want to put a tank underneath to give you a little coverage.	1
I wasn't overly impressed or drawn to this dress at first, even after i bought it, but after wearing it, i am sold! i paired the orange version with caramel colored sandals and gold jewelry. i thought it was necessary to wear a long necklace to bring some interest to the otherwise plain top. the dress is super comfortable - fabric, fit and length. it billows in such a pretty way when you walk! the color also made my skin look extra tan, which i loved! the waist is short and rides up now and then	1
Had to return this for a couple of reasons: 1) was too small! it's made like one of those tiny mittens that stretches to fit any size hand. i didn't bother to order a size up because i wasn't sure whether to go from a small to a medium or to a large. 2) the main color isn't grey, like the picture. it's a black and white checkered pattern. so, it doesn't look at all grey irl. i'm still recommending because, if you get the right size, and like the colors, it will be a nice, light and comfy swea	1
I passed up this dress so many times in the store and finally tried it on today because i wanted a casual dress while traveling in the cape. i was surprised how much cuter it is on than on hanger. i sized down to get a more fitting look and really made a difference for me in style. i was not a fan of the way it looked so loose on model. it looks really cute fitted and a bit sexy even. it is lined and very comfy and can be dressed up a but for work with a cardi. i believe i will get a lot of wear	1
Due to the prior review, this top came without any surprises.  i had read about the open sleeves and actually have a dress with a similar design.  this top can be dressed up or down and is perfect with skinny pants.	1
This product is just what i wanted. it was a great color and nice quality for the price. it is tighter than the model, but i am curvy and that's usually the case. looks cute with a patterned pant and jewelry!	1
"The shirt is absolutely cute looking. but that's just that....looks. i'm 5'2"" size 6 & wears m to l top. i tried on the medium in the store, it was rather flowing. i liked it. but i didn't like how it fit on the underarm area. it hung very low. so i ordered a petite m. still the same. plus the store the lighting was dark so i didn't realize how see through the shirt was too. had to return it."	0
"Classic dress with a twist with split colors. very comfortable without looking like a bag on. can be dressed up or down. i am 5'7"" 118 and bought th extra small. perfect fit for me. not form fitting but still has shape and style."	1
I absolutely love this blouse...i ordered it in peach..then waited for the raspberry to come back in my size...now i have 2 colors...it runs really large....but putting a tank or cami underneath is fun :-)	1
"I ""studied"" this dress for weeks before i finally bought it. i am soooo glad i bought it. much more fabulous than the picture. soft, quality denim that is not too heavy for summer. very fitted on top. love the pockets and the torn hem."	1
I am wearing this right now! it's a funny fabric--almost like a bedspread--but the cut and fit are perfect. i am short and i love the length of the hem, the babydoll style and the 3/4 sleeve. very cute for summer work or going out.	1
When i read all these positive reviews i did not hesitated, as i wanted good basics which will be good investment in me as looking good is always investment. well, i love blue color as i am blonde wih blue eyes and this color makes my eyes brighter and matches almost everything but..the design of the shirt is made oversize fit basically the shirt should not be dressed as fitted it's more relaxed fit so if you wear medium go head and order medium even if the small fits unless you want to look lik	0
Love this top!! fits perfectly & it's lovely	1
I tried this on at the store - the fuzzy trim around the bib is adorable and the overall texture with little puffs woven into the fabric has a nice quality feel to it. the pattern of flamingos is fun and the fabric is soft. it does run on the big and flowy side. i thought it was very cute and comfy but ultimately did not buy it because the price is rather high and the petite length is sold out. i'll snap it up if it goes on sale.	1
"I love the contemporary style of this piece, but i returned it because the side slits were too high even for a short person like me (5'1""). but if you don't mind showing a little skin at the waist when you raise your arms, it might work for you. the fabric has a nice texture and the muted colors would mix well with other pieces."	1
"This dress is gorgeous. it swings beautifully, it's soft, it's incredibly flattering! i would say it runs big. i ordered an xxs petite, normally i would wear xs petite, and it fits great. for reference, i'm 5'1"" and a 32dd. finally a loose fitting dress that doesn't make me look pregnant!"	1
"I ordered it with a particular outfit in mind as i liked the purple (burgundy) color. ordered xxsp, as with most t-shirts at retailer, they run a little big. xxs seems to be my new xs (which used to be s!). color was nice , fit was good too, i just felt not ""special"" enough... but if you are looking for a tshirt, then i say give it a try, as it was comfortable and the shape at least is unusual. for reference, 115 lbs, 30dd, 26.5 in waist"	1
This is about the cutest thing since...well i don't know but it's pretty cute. yes, i agree with the other reviewer who said it looked better in hand than on the web! has cute, soft ruffle just above hip and the stripes are soft pastels. the buttons at the nape of the neck are sweet. there's the word-sweet-that's the perfect descriptive for this quirky, laid back, feminine piece. tts-nothing weird or uncomfortable about the fit but it does seem a bit shorter than the picture shows. i am 140 lbs	1
I am petite but chesty and this dress is flattering. it is a loose fit but not tight across the bust line. i tried it on with nude shoes and it dresses it up. i ended up buying this dress in a regular cut (s) because i wanted it to not be so short which made it look more like a casual dress to wear with the ocean behind you. i think it is a perfect day dress to go anywhere and by changing your shoes or adding a thin sweater or short jacket you can go out to dinner or theatre. the picture is a tr	1
Loved the style and color/design but this dress was simply too short in the front. the slip was also slightly tight over hips. i wish this was longer!	1
Like other reviewers, i tried on a medium and a large as i usually take either size in retailer dresses. the large was huge on me - i had an extra 6 inches or so on each side. the next medium that i tried on could barely fit over my head! i looked at the tag to see if i had picked up an extra small but it stated medium. got another medium and it fit perfectly. however, the cami underneath one medium was again teeny tiny. the other medium was ok. you may have to try on a few dresses to get the righ	1
"Gorgeous sleeves, flattering neckline...and a voluminous torso. i loved the fit of the top portion so much, i decided to buy it, knowing it would require alteration. the seamstress removed a *significant* amount of bulk and added vintage buttons to clasp the inverted pleat. i find many of these ""easy breezy"" tops create a shapeless look. extra volume in both the front and back creates a needlessly rotund profile. despite excellent posture, i looked both hunched and pregnant in the unaltered silh"	0
Very pretty sweater! i love the bell sleeves with the design on the sides. the sweater runs a bit short though and wish it hung a little longer. looks great with flare jeans and boots!	1
"I wore this for the first time this weekend and loved it. it is long and lean but not baggy or tent like. i'm 6'0"" so i appreciate the length and fit.  will get a lot of use out of this. good w/ skinny jeans and i can't seem to have enough black tops."	1
This top is really cute- the plum is a lovely color and the top fits true to size. love the back detailing. and it is really good t-shirt quality.	1
I got this before the winter. so i could wear it for summer and fall. it is light wave material for summer and fall. i think it would be good for spring time too.the color of this pants is more natural so it is easy to march any color of tops.i really enjoy it.	1
Runs very large. ordered a smaller size due to other reviews but should have ordered several sizes smaller	0
Great design & execution - this is essentially a striped jersey sleeveless turtleneck, made of a nice, high-quality jersey. with a delicate lightweight soft sweater attached over it. so you get this really pretty look where the jersey underlay means the sweater hangs beautifully, no clinging at all. and the sleeves are just the sheer sweater - so pretty. i got the lavender - looks exactly like the pic. and it is true to size.	1
Great pants, like the edginess of the design in the material. kinda rocker like. soft material that's stretchy and hopefully will hold its shape during the day. the color is listed as black but it's more of a dark gray with a slight blue hint.	1
I was returning an in line order from same designer and saw this dress. i love it. much prettier in person. this will get well worn by me!	1
I think when this is new, it runs big, and then shrinks to the right size. that's what it did for me anyway. it did shrink after one wash, but not significantly. i bought it in m and feel it stayed within that range. super cute with shorts - airy, light. love the white. ordering another color!	1
I have a hard time finding jeans that fit and these ones are just right! i am 5'8, 125ish lbs and the 26s fix perfectly; they hug in all the right places and they are the perfect length. i will be wearing them uncuffed. there is no effort required to uncuff them, they're not sewn or anything. they have just the right amount of stretch and love the little cute details throughout them. thank you, retailer, for always helping me find great jeans!	1
The great thing about a swing dress is that it doesn't cling to the curves. this one is the same way. i got the geometric print. the colors are fun. i would have gone down to the small just to loose some of the material on this dress if it had not fit across so tight across the back. if you have no bust, i would say size down two sizes or try a petite. the dress has a breathable fabric so great for summer wear. the only cons are the large armpits and extra fabric but sizing down should help.	1
I like this dress. the floral pattern and little red beads. others may think it is baggy, however, i like this type of the style.	1
An absolutely gorgeous, but poorly fitting blouse. the bottom part is way too billowy and inconsistent with the fitted top half. got it on sale and still returned it.	0
I've been looking at these online for a while now, and couldn't decide if they'd fit me or not. i have large, muscular thighs and pants always run tight. when i was in the store today i decided to try them on anyway, and boy am i glad i did. the fabric is super soft, as everyone else mentions, and they are nice and loose, but also look like ankle pants. i actually sized down! (who doesn't love it when they get to do that?!) i loved the way they fit so much, i bought two pairs. i love the pastel	1
Although i haven't worn it yet, it is very soft and functional. i will watch how i wash it so it stays that way.	1
I love this top, but i washed it once, in cold water, and hung it dry. it shrunk just enough that it's now too tight around the bust and gaps open up between buttons there. so disappointing! i will have to send it back.	1
"Love this shirt. i am 5'2"" and 115 lbs. i am normally a pxs and got the pxxs and it got perfect! my new favorite shirt."	1
Love these pants. the color is a true red and they are very flattering on. i ordered the 6 but they are a little big and i think the pant will give a little when wearing. just reordered the size 4.	1
This blouse is exactly what i wanted and the fit is great. silk is always light, and can go with jeans or dress up with a skirt. i'm wearing mine to a baby shower in a few weeks.	1
This is already sold out in petites and the reason for this is asymmetrical stripes: this is the most flattering design for tops. horizontal stripes only look good on people trying to look bigger and heavier. do you know anyone like that, b/c i don't! vertical stripes, while slimming, generally look a little severe, modern, weird (occasionally great), while asymmetrical stripes knock 5lbs off a person. stock more asymmetrical striped tops, please!	1
I don't normally write reviews, but this shirt was so terrible, that i felt inspired.  first off, the seam that is in both the front and back of the shirt is much more pronounced than in the photo. secondly, there is no shape whatsoever, unlike in the photo. it bells out like a tent. it honestly looks like a shirt you would buy if you were trying to appear pregnant when not. overall, this shirt is an insult to the female form.  retailer, what is with all of these shapeless, frocks in cheap f	0
The top is nice, good quality, etc.... but how do you keep the 'off the shoulder' off the shoulder? mine keeps inching up until it's just a boring white top with a strange loose neckline.	0
This dress was returned to our store and i was intrigued the second i saw it. the dress is definitely oversized. so much so that you could probably size down a size or two. but what i love about this dress is the style. its meant to be oversized...and with the print, the asymmetric cut and the oversized look...its very unique! the color is exactly as it appears and the material is wonderful. thin but soft and comfortable...really easy to wear! you could do this as a dress, or with leggings and b	1
I tried these on at the store and thought the color, texture and style was very nice, but i needed the petite length. so i came online but was disappointed to see that the style is sold out in petite! darn. the regular length hits me just above the ankle, so i suppose it is still do-able, but i hate to pay full price for something that doesn't fit quite right. maybe if it goes on sale i will consider it.	1
This is a fun dress to have in your closet! i ordered the 4p, and it was just a little to short for my taste. had the regular 4 sent, and it was perfect! i wore it the very next night to a party... feels great and lots of fun with the bel sleeves!	1
"I had high hopes for this top but sadly it was not meant to be. it was tts (i'm 5""3 and usually wear a small). but the material was horribly scratchy. both the body of the top as well as the sleeves. and the design isn't all that flattering. it made me look really wide at the bottom and i definitely am not in real life!"	0
Love this shirt! it runs a bit big, i ordered the (petite) 4 and its a bit long in the sleeves if i don't roll them up, and a bit long and big in the back. but i love the look and it is classic. great with skinny jeans.	1
This dress is gorgeous. more ivory in person. the crochet is amazing. i sized up from my normal s to a m, only bc i wanted a loose fit. and after reading reviews that it fit a little bit like a shift, i wanted a bigger size. but a small would have prob worked as well. depends on how you want this to fit. i love it. i wear mine now w a cropped jean jacket and leggings, soon w just sandals. great transition piece bc it's a slightly heavy dress but not enough to be overwhelming or hot for the summe	1
Love this shawl/wrap! was looking to purchase the white & warren cashmere poncho (but available online only), and then saw this in the store. tried it on and fell in love. love that it's 100% cashmere -- super soft and warm. would recommend!	1
This jacket is perfect. swings just the right amount without looking too big.	1
The fabric of these pants isn't like regular denim, rather it's soft and velvety in texture more like a chino. i love the dark saturated olive green. the pocket placement is very flattering on the rear. normally i wear a size 31 in premium denim and size 30 in paige jimmy jimmy jeans, however in this particular pair i needed a size 29. i definitely recommend sizing down!	1
The lines on the dress are lovely. the material is a nice thick jersey, which can be body-hugging, but mostly on top. it falls beautifully and looks good with heels and flats and boots. i am xs or s depending on the dress, and i got the xs in this one.	1
"I wore this dress to a july wedding in miami beach, and if you know sofla, you know that it's hot, humid and sultry. despite the weather, the dress was light, especially at the bottom because of the slits, so i wasn't terribly hot and sweaty underneath the dress. the slip is a good length, not too short and not too long, which makes for a sexy fit.  sizingwise, i'm 5'4"" and weigh about 120 lbs. and purchased the dress in pxxs. i said the dress was tts because it fit a little bit snug at the u"	1
Love these leggings. great fit, great look. perfect with boots and oversized sweater. bought a couple of different fabrics. highly recommend.	1
Love it! perfect casual look with a jacket and booties	1
Super cute but the fabric was so thin & flimsy i was afraid it would fall apart once it was washed so returned it.	0
This product fit well and was soft and beautifully made.	1
At first, i thought this sweater might be too boxy, but fastened at the waist, it's very flattering and the collar is face-framing, and the coral in particular (really more of a mango sorbet shade) is unexpected but cheery for winter. but the big selling point is the warmth and the giant pockets. brought a new puppy home just after christmas, and this sweater is perfect for layering for late- night trips out with an easy place to stash my phone and treats. bought it in coral and pink.	1
Really beautiful pants but run a very large-i usually wear four and am 5 10-the media was way too big in the waste and elsewhere and very long.	1
I initially tried this on in store and fell in love with the beautiful cut out details and fit. the star design is really cute and unique and the blue color is not see-through at all. i eventually had to buy the blouse online because i could not stop thinking about it. also machine washable is a major plus.	1
As another reviewer mentioned, maeve really needs to get their sizing under control and more consistent. i ordered a 4, and while it fits, i think a 6 would be more comfortable in the arms and shoulders (and i'm a thin build). the length on this was also a little weird to me...a little swingy/flared, but also short, making me feel like i'd always be playing with it while wearing. the orange print is absolutely adorable, i just wish the cut were more similar to past buttondowns that maeve has don	1
"I love it! i was hesitant to spend so much on a suit, but it's well worth the money. i'm 5'3"", 140 lbs, and my stomach is my biggest problem area. i ordered a size 8 and it's a perfect fit and very flattering."	1
I originally bought this in medium, my normal size. when it arrived, it was absolutely huge, like wearing teepee. i took it back to the store, and re ordered a small, in the black, and now it fits great. this is a great shirt, but giving four stars due to the inconvenience.	1
I'm a consistent size 6 (ordered a small) with a pretty athletic build (wide shoulders and strong arms) and this dress simply did not fit with those proportions. the sleeves and back were far too tight. additionally, the bow did not cover my bra strap, likely because it isn't made for someone my height. had to return.	0
This is a lovely dress, but much more casual than i thought from the picture. the material is very thin and casual. i needed a dressier dress, and i didn't need another casual dress, so i sent it back, but it would be fine if you want something casual.	1
This dress is incredibly soft! with sleeves that can be rolled up or down, it is extremely versatile. while the dress is very comfortable and mostly fits true to size, i found it to be ever so slightly snug through the hips at first. however, i am somewhat difficult to fit with an accentuated hourglass figure. overall, i am very happy with this purchase and look forward to wearing it during my travels!	1
The colors in this dress are much less vibrant in person. the scoop of the neckline is very wide and deep. i know others have posted that this is a great dress for work, but not in my workplace.	0
"Ordered this blouse in a small but it was too big, returned it for an xs. i weigh 123 lbs , i'm 5'3 1/2"". i find sizing of clothing at retailer to be unreliable, i have had to return many items because of sizing issues. unfortunately i live too far away from a regular store so have to rely on shopping on line. i will complement retailer on the unique designs of the clothing they offer."	1
I ordered this in an xl and when i pulled it out of the bag, it seemed huge. (i wear both l and xl, depending on the sizing) when i tried it, it did look like the photo - it's meant to be a little voluminous. the arms were a little snug, so sizing down was out of the question. it looks great tucked in to a pair of flair jeans. i gave the asthetic four stars because of the design, which is just a teeny bit off. the lace is delicate too, btw, so care will be needed not to snag it.	1
I am a fan of flutter sleeves, always have been. however, at 42 years old i sometimes feel as if i can't carry them off. not the case with this shirt. bordeaux has found a way to balance just sleeve with femininity and maturity. i'm a size 12 in jeans and tops. i ordered s large and it fit beautifully. very flattering.	1
This cardigan is very cute and versatile. the knit is medium weight and will work well for moderate weather. i would say that the sizing is pretty true to size, but maybe runs just a bit large. thus, if you are in between sizes, order the smaller size.	1
I already have one pair of sleep pants by retailer and was looking for a second pair. i wanted something warm and comfortable for the fall and upcoming winter weather. (i live in the rockies.) as soon as i saw the woodland animal print on these pants i had to try them. i mean seriously, how cute are the raccoons and other critters here? when they arrived at first i thought they might be too thin for winter wear, but when i put them on i was pleasantly surprised by the soft, comfy fabric. i	1
I have discovered that i'm really picky about t-shirts. it's hard to find a cute, flattering one that you can wear with whatever. this one is perfect. the neckline is different, the sleeves are short -- almost cap sleeves. it fits nicely everywhere. i am an 8/10 and the medium fit well. i love that it's a dark enough color and not sheer (why are so many of your clothes see through, retailer?!!!) , so i don't have to layer something under it just to wear it. it's thin enough that you can wear it in	1
This dress is magical. i wore it to a christmas party and felt like the belle of the ball. my dress swirled around me as i spun on the dance floor. later, i spilled a tequila-ginger all over the front. i was devastated, but it almost instantly dried and there are no stains!!! you can't even tell i spilled! it is hand-washable, which is great as well! i am 4'11 and 100lbs. the xxsp fit like a glove. highly recommend! any other dress would have been ruined but this one was literally magical.	1
The top on the model in the photo is a true ivory, but the top in reality is more beige. well, i'm blonde with fair skin, so i'm not sure this is going to work. it also looks more dressy in the photo than it does in reality -- i think the ivory color on the model and the pleats only down the front make it look more dressy -- but in reality, with it really being beige, having pleats everywhere, and being a crinkly fabric, it looks more casual. i had wanted it to be more dressy to pair with skirts	0
I found this jumpsuit at my local retailer it must have been a web order return i love it the fit is true size the colors are perfect it's very comfortable and gorgeous on and at the sale price i could not pass it up	1
"Beautiful print and a flattering cut. however, the proportions are off. based on other reviews, i ordered a petite (i am 5'4"" and don't normally need a petite cut). i also ordered a size down. even the 0 petite requires that i wear 3-4 inch wedges and pin the top in the back to keep it in place. i am going to take it to a tailor to have the hem shortened and the top sleeves adjusted...then maybe the v neck won't be almost to my belly button."	1
I love this dress so much, i've considered getting it in the other prints. it's fitted in all the right places and has pockets! i love that it's stretchy. i'm a 36d and it's hard to fit dresses over the chest. this dress is a dream!	1
I tried on a returned 24p in my store, they were almost the right length, but the fit was more snug than pictured here (i have muscular thighs/butt, and 115 lbs). they were nice though, kind of a skinny pant. the carbon is a dark grey, can go with anything... only gripe is the waist height is low, at least on the behind... i would certainly show if i bend down without a long top.	1
"I love lace dresses and this one is no exception. great construction and color. i paired the dress with a plum colored blazer and i really was pleased at how well it all went together. i'm about 5'8"" and 170 i'm normally an 8 or 10 at retailer, my 8 fits great and is not tight at all, so i'm thinking it may run a tad bit big."	1
This dress is cute and comfortable. big but not too big, skimming. i usually wear a 12 pant and bought a medium and it is great. i am on the taller side and the length was great too.	1
"Love the silhouette and coziness of the fabric. for the first few wearings, i was in love. then it began to pill horribly . . . would not recommend. my mother said, ""that's going to pill up."" and i ignored her. and she was right."	0
"I bought this online with the intention of it being my graduation dress. i'm 5'2"", 115 pounds so i should've known better and gotten a ""petite"" style dress. however, i loved the modern look of this and since my boobs are a bit bigger (34d) i figured they would help fill it out. upon receiving the dress, i was first shocked that for the price, the construction was pretty poor quality: there were strings coming out of the straps and they looked unevenly sewn. when i put it on, it was clear that th"	0
I fell in love with this shirt in the store and it has become one of my favorite items in my closet! the bright pink contrasts perfectly with the white peplum bottom and the fit is wonderfully flattering!	1
I was excited to order this dress based on the reviews. it was better than i expected. the fit is perfect and one of the most comfortable dresses i own. the fit is flattering and i will get plenty of use out of this one!	1
Not sure where to start with this top...it's that good! i am usually a large in most maeve tops and that's sizing up for extra flow. i ended up grabbing this piece of perfection in an xl only because it ran a little shorter than i anticipated and was kind of tight through my shoulders. i wanted more flow (as always) so i went up in size. for that reason i feel it runs pretty true to size. this is the perfect transition piece from summer to fall and is definitely a must have! it has sold out with	1
I love the quality of this little gem. it's going to be used as an under a sweater top and also to fill a v-neck line dress up that's too low for me. it's made very well in my opinion but it runs a bit too full so if you are between sizes you could easily go down a size.	1
I got two of the shirt am totally in love with them. i didn't get the one in black only because i have too many things in black. the shirts look awesome with leggings or skinny jeans. i'm very happy with this purchase!!!	1
Love this top. bought it in both color ways. just adorable and washes well. great option for larger ladies.  retailer needs to provide more xls to be available in the stores. i shop at the pasadena store and see so many women my size shopping right next to me, and there is nothing for us. it is so sad that we want to spend our money with you, but you don't want it.	1
Just a heads up - this is a romper - pants and not a dress! you can't tell from the pictures. i ordered thinking it was a dress but it's actually ... culottes? i'm not sure what you would call it. the pull on styling was awkward and the sash was bulky. it definitely goes back!	0
I have never written a review before, and i love retailer and shop here often. however, i am so unhappy with this shirt i wanted to share to save someone else money. it is such poor quality, it looks thick and flows in the photo, it is very thin and it itches so bad, i could hardly even stand to try it on when it came in the mail. i will deff be taking it back, and do not recommend it at all.	0
"My husband bought it for me and i was a bit skeptical at first. tried it on and absolutely loved it. besides the really soft fabric, it has pockets which makes it even more comfortable for me! i'm 5'8"", 123lbs. and flat chested. he got me a medium, which fits a bit tight, but my husband likes it so it's a keeper!"	1
I love the sparkled fabric and intricate design on the back. i had trouble with the front because the cowl exposed a bit too much, so i wore a tank top underneath. ordering a petite may have helped with the cowl.	1
"I don't know that i'll keep this, although i really want to. i love the style and the fabric, and the length is perfect for me (i'm 5'3"" and i ordered the petite length - it hits me below the knee). as another reviewer mentioned, this dress runs small in the chest area and does not provide any stretch. luckily for me, that wasn't an issue. my trouble is this: the liner stops just above the slits on the side, and it's way more noticeable in person than in the photo. the liner is sewn in and yo"	1
I seriously wanted to cry when this dress didn't fit me. i knew ordering it that it was a long shot. i'm a 36d and strapless rarely works. this was no different. the dress ran true to size and it is precious!	1
I tried this on (blue) in size 0 or xs (not sure how sizing was), regular size (sometimes i need petite). i don't think i need petite in this one though, i love the peek of lighter solid fabric on the hem, the whole tank is very soft. probably need a strapless bra to wear it, but could be paired with jeans for casual look or nice pants. pencil skirt for dressier look. i am 115 lbs and 30 dd for reference.	1
Love this white shirt! it fits great and gives you a little breathing room around the waist. this goes with shorts, skirts, and jeans. i will be wearing it all summer	1
I've tried or bought nearly every retailer cashmere sweater this season. this one fits the best and the yellow is a bit darker in person, not quite mustard but a deep rich yellow. i wish they would offer more colors.	1
Very nicely made sweater which fits well. i bought the black with white accent and am very pleased with my purchase. the small fit me perfectly (34d) can't wait to wear it this fall!	1
I love this shirt so much!!! i ordered the gray a day after i received the sage color. this shirt is soft, true to size, comfortable and extremely flattering. it is one of my new favorite go-to shirts. retailer - great job at finding a stylish, casual top that can take me through all the seasons.	1
Great flow and and spring color. short waisted and fit wonderfully. i can see how long waisted people would have an issue.	1
I was not in the market for a black blazer but saw this in store and had to try it on. the quality of the fabric and overall aesthetic is fantastic! love love love the gold buttons. this will look great for work, with jeans, or even as a cover up over a cute dress. i am a generally a size medium (sometimes small) and tend to fall between a 6 and 8, i went with the 8 in this jacket!	1
The stitching is why i like this dress. even though the arms and waist were a little large on me, i decided to keep it because of the beautiful pattern. (i think going a size down from what i normally wear would be too tight across my back or too short.) i will wear it with a cardigan, tights, and boots as the weather gets cooler.	1
This fit me perfectly with a little room but think it's meant to be this way so easier to get on and off. this feels like a dream and is very good quality. definitely a heavier piece but i like that. it is so very flattering and drapes beautifully to hide my tummy. the back is adorable too! retailer hit it out of park with this one! grab it before it's too late! i'm a 36ddd and size 14 and the large fit perfectly	1
....that's what i look like wearing this dress. a sad, sad, sack. the fabric is less than ideal, and there is no shape to speak of. i love that it has pockets but that's about it. there was just way too much fabric for a petite person. this dress has got to be good on someone, sadly that person was not me.	0
"This is such a lovely blouse! the color is true to the picture. i am a bigger girl--5'9"" and size 12, and i bought the large. the fit was beautiful--it was forgiving on my less-than-perfect midsection, but wasn't billowy at all. it did not pull around the shoulders or bust the way some button-up blouses do."	1
"This is a bit pricey, but it's the most beautiful sweater that i own. it fits beautifully, and the material is soft, not itchy, which is important for a sweater with a cowl neck. the cowl sits beautifully, no matter how you ""fold"" it. and, the pattern both at the neck and the bottom is vibrant and bright, and is just lovely. i ordered a small and it covers my butt, which is perfect for leggings, or even with tights and boots. it's not shapeless, but seems to graze your thighs, and has a mild tur"	1
I'm going through a blouse phase, and this was exactly what i wanted. i'm not svelte, and blouses rarely hang off my frame in a flowy flattering manner, but this one is perfect! it is just loose enough and just form accentuating enough that it looks amazing! i am petite with broad shoulders and a large ribcage/short torso, so flowy is a tough one for me.	1
Love the detailing around the neck of this top looks great under cardigan or by itself. i sized down to an xs. seems to be of good quality although to lengthen its life i don't plan on putting it in the dryer :)	1
These leggings are gorgeous. soft suede feel, perfect fit, great look, especially for dressing up and going out. love them.	1
I got the burgundy color and i do have to say that the color looks a little better online than it does in person, but it's not too much of a difference. this is a really cute thong, and if you're just trying to be sexy/romantic, then i think it would be fine and there's nothing at all wrong with it. however, i like to wear thongs just in general because i think they're comfortable and i like not having to worry about panty lines, and this is definitely not the most comfortable. the front pattern	1
I love this shirtdress. the lace and collar design pops off the black. super comfortable and love that it has pockets! a keeper, this one not going back ever. i am 5'9 and 140 lbs and the 6 fits perfect. the length comes above my knee, so most likely i will be wearing tights or skinny's underneath.	1
The quality is good, as is the design idea, but, practically, it doesn't work. ordered an xs and the top still ballooned out stiffly. this top is not soft or flowy, it is stiff and very wide.	0
This dress is by no means a statement piece, but if you're in need of a good basic to get you through winter, this is a great option. i'm normally a m or l (busty and hippy hourglass shape) and found it to fit tts in a l. (if you fall in-between two sizes but don't have larger hips or a larger bust like i do, you could probably size down to the smaller of your two sizes.) it goes great with black tights, tall black boots and a scarf. i didn't realize at the time i ordered it that the material is	1
Wow! i saw this dress in the store and had to try it on. it is simply stunning! the bright colors and design are a true tracy reese dress and i looked like a fairy queen in it! lol. i can't wait to wear it!	1
Looks nice and i did like the button detail on the collar. colors are nove and the feel is soft. i would probably have to get a petite smaller size.	1
I got this dress on sale (under 20 dollars) but i would pay more!  it runs very large - i got a medium which is roomy, irl i wear a large (vanity sizing i suppose!).  the colors are so pretty, it is lined so you don't need a slip or cami.  highly recommend!	1
An odd top. for my curvy figure (34g), the seam did not enhance, but rather made me look wider. the material is...interesting. foam-like is all i can think to describe it. the fabric and design are not as elegant looking in person.	0
I am now the third person to try this dress and return it for the same reason. the empire waist is too high and hits across the bust instead of underneath it. i can't imagine how they got it to fit this model so well. i am petite and i really love the idea of a maxi with sleeves, so i decided to try it even through the two previous reviewers reported this issue. unfortunately, i had the same problem. i am a c+ cup size. perhaps this would work on a very thin figure with a small bust. i ordered t	0
No size fit me. i'm normally a s to m. the small had huge armholes on me and the xs was just a wee bit off somehow. perhaps in length. so i ended up without it sadly. it's really a very nice top and great quality. i was unhappy to leave it behind.	1
This is exactly the same cut as the breton peasant blouse, which i also ordered. it's extremely tight thru the bust and the sleeves are very wide at the top which adds width to the look of this blouse. it added 20 pounds! the print is beautiful. the ruffles are trimmed with a golden colored thread which is a beautiful detail. i ordered size large and am well endowed. steer clear if you have a bust.	0
Soft, slouchy, and comfortable. what more could you ask for?	1
I love this tunic, i wore it with black leggings and boots. it is well made and flowy. i wish it came in more colors.	1
"This dress is extremely comfortable and looks great on. i'm 5'3"" and 34dd and the m petite fit like a dream with even a bit of room at the bust. the length is perfect with sandals or even up to 2-inch heels. perfect for travel and summer entertaining!"	1
This is a beautiful top but the fit is odd. it's roomy and flowy in the bust and waist but the arms are disproportionately tight. i wear a size 8 in all hd in paris tops but this one didn't fit anything like the others. i wouldn't even know what size to recommend because it's almost too big in the body, while being too tight in the arms. the lace and mock neck is beautiful though so i'm hoping to find someway to wear it comfortably. otherwise, it will be going back.	1
This is a very nice, well made skirt but beware, it runs extremely large in size around the waist. i usually wear a m in most things, and i am going to return this skirt for an xs.	1
I love this shirt! it's such a beautiful striking color, yet still simple enough to not take the spotlight. the peekaboo shoulders are totally cute. i bought another one of these when it went on sale. so now i have two just in case;) haha	1
There is a lot of fabric here! the legs fit me fine, but they are long and when you roll them up it creates a bunching of fabric in an awkward area. i've also found that they don't stay rolled up in the back, especially if you sit down. it's a shame since the fabric is soft and comfortable. maybe sizing down would've helped, but i doubt that would've fixed the problem of the cuffs staying rolled up.	0
Does not look like the picture. lined with a cheap denim fabric inside that shows when arms are rolled up. i normally always fit in mediums and this jacket is so small in the arms as well as body that it fit like a xs.	0
I love the 2 straps details, funny thing though is thsi bra is giving me rounder boobs... a little cleavage, nto waht i am sued to with a sports bra. lvoe the color (ordered the purple).	1
I was in the store today and saw this dress in blue and had to try it on. i usually wear a size 10 in tops to accommodate my large chest, but the size 8 fit great with even a little room to spare. they didn't have the petite 8, so i ended up with the regular size, which falls an inch or so above my ankles. i am 5'2, so the petite may fit better as a midi dress, however, i really love the length. the fabric is soft and airy. can't wait to wear this once the weather is warmer.	1
This dress is cute and i will wear it to work. i only decided to keep it because i got the sale price and an additional 40 percent off. the print is cute, but a little bit odd, it's a swimmer in a cap. the tie is fun.	1
The armholes on this dress are totally bizarre. i can't believe no one else has commented on them yet. i am a size s on top and m on the bottom so i usually try on both in dresses. i tend to be a small/ size 6 in retailer. the armholes are so long that the dress doesn't lay right on top. i showed it to on of the clerks in the store and she agreed with me. we looked at all the others and they were the same. going up a size made it way worse. this dress might work for someone with really broad shoul	0
This vest is a stunner! the dark brown suede is so beautiful. the bronze grommets on the front are a perfect enhancement to the vest. it's hard to see in the picture but the stitching is also top notch. yes, it is a little pricey but it's an investment piece that you will wear and not only get a ton of compliments but feel special when wearing it too. it's a keeper!!!	1
Beautiful top! you can wear it as a wide boat neck or as its pictured off the shoulder. the bottom is tight with ruching which makes it very flattering. i found the fit true to size. love the neutral light brown color. will look nice with white denim for the summer. excited to dress this unique top up or down.	1
"Absolutely perfect and worth every penny! i am 5'8"" and normally between a 4 and 6 in jackets. while the small fit, i ended up purchasing a medium so i had more room in the arms. insanely comfortable and truly stunning on. expect compliments when you are wearing it!"	1
Beautiful dress but runs very large. it is made of a material that does not breath so if you tend to run hot, skip this dress. great style and looks good on almost any body type. colors are very attractive and is dressy enough for special occasions,	1
Absolutely wonderful - silky and sexy and comfortable	1
Super cute basic top but after washing it once according to tag instructions, it is pilling like a well-worn sweater would.	1
I tried on the xs and the shoulder are fit, but the body seemed so wide on me, it took me over... i don't know if xxs would have worked, but it is not available (and petite either). fabric is soft enough for denim, color is nice, overall, really pretty dress, just unfortunately big. and i have wide shoulders. 30dd chest, 26.5 in wasit, big legs, 115 lbs.	1
I love this sweater it's so cute and so soft, and warm!	1
I found these jeans on the sale rack at my local retailer. they were the very last pair and in my size. i couldn't believe my luck.  i tried them on and was very impressed with the fit and feel of the jeans. thyre soft yet substantial. they retain thier shape. . love the worn in look to them.  .. .. so adorable.  nice slouchy skinny jean.. i stayed true to size	1
A very beautiful, flattering, and breathable/comfortable mock neck turtleneck that's great for layering. for those unfamiliar with weston, this top - like many of their others - is essentially made of panty hose nylon. it makes for a super comfy and stretchy top, albeit a delicate one. be mindful with your hair accessories and jewelery when wearing this! ------ i wish the arms were lined - i have a large tattoo on my arm and you can see it through this, and it just looks a little odd when mixe	1
Perfect high rise jeans - just a little bit of stretch for comfort. the high waist doesn't roll down and no knicker cleavage when bending over. perfect to go with crop tops	1
I bought this dress for its green color and flowy design to wear at an irish fest held in the hot summer. it's perfect! being of irish descent with red hair and fair skin, i love all shades of green, and this green dress is no exception. the color is lovely and eye-catching and cool. as to the sizing, i usually wear a size 8, but to make sure due to the design, i ordered an 8 and a 6. there wasn't a great difference between the two dresses, but the size 6 top was a bit more fitted and looked bet	1
This is a sweet little jacket. i saw it in the store but was unsure because of the price. but after trying it on, i just fell in love! the cut is really flattering. the jacket does run small. i really enjoy the little pop of color on the sleeves. my only complaint is the buttons make me nervous, because they seem to be heavy and i worry that i'll lose one, but only on the front 2, the arms and back buttons seem to be just fine. overall this is a fantastic buy that is great for an office setting	1
The dress is  very feminine and very flirty. i love orange/melon-colored dresses. this one does not disappoint. it does run extremely small around the rib cage. i had to size up to a 6 when i typically wear a 2 or 4. my bra size is 32 b. nice quality fabric, lined, with built-in bustier.	1
This dress is seriously gorgeous, and even more so in person. the cut at the bottom is so flattering for curvy , pear shaped, and hourglass shaped women. i sized down so that the dress gave me more of a waist than you can see on the model and it was so much more flattering. love the fabric, fit and style of this dress.	1
"Ah! i wanted to love this but without anything under it (as pictured), the petite sizing reveals way too much side boob. i am 5'3"" and a small b cup. i ordered an xs petite. it fits but there isn't enough material under the armpits. the fabric and design is great other than this flaw. sadly returning."	0
I wanted to love these, but the zipper is extremely short and they were not flattering on my thicker thighs and large behind. the fabric is so soft, however and the color is great. would work on a less curvy woman!	1
Gorgeous dress, but so low in front and in back...i couldn't figure out how to pull it off without a cardigan/sweater. beautiful fabric and color.	0
The design is loose and forgiving, and it is very comfortable. the fabric is soft and light weight, and i love how the sleeves are full cut so even those without stick arms can fit in them! it drapes beautifully and is quite lovely on. you can easily dress it up with jewelry or wear it over jeans for a great go-to top on the weekend. i also bought the purple version - it says it's mauve in the description, but it's really more of a pale lavender color. still very pretty, but i wish it was mauve!	1
I do recommend this dress with some caveats. 1: it'll be difficult to find a bra that won't show straps, and 2: it's very figure flattering so if you're body conscious, particularly tummy	1
Even more beautiful in person. runs large as i'm usually a medium and bought a small. great for summer/fall transition.	1
Far more attractive in person than online. earlier reviews are all accurate. very flattering and quality manufacturing. the scarf bow makes it so distinctive.	1
"This skirt is a beautiful fabric, heavy and soft, and fully lined. it has two sets of snaps on the inside so you can adjust the waist size. i purchased a medium, but found that there wasn't enough of an overlap in the split to be decent (it flaps open when i walk, revealing nearly everything!), so i will be exchanging for a large. for reference, i typically wear a size 10 or 12 in pants and skirts. the color is true to the photos, with a matte finish. i am 5'8"" and length hit me below the knee."	1
I didn't look close enough when i ordered and failed to see that this was a peplum top.  it did not do my post-pregnancy body any favors.  but the collar area detail is quite nice and this would look great on the right body.	1
Ordered this online in the pinkish color. the material is a little thin. as a busty, curvy lady this one just didn't sit right, ran a tad large, and looked boxy. if you have a thinner frame, may be a better look for you. detailing is nice.	0
I have the purple and the white. i purchased the purple first in m. it wasn't too big to return, but it was a little roomier than necessary but when i saw the white on sale, i purchased it in s which fit just fine--still plenty roomy as the style allows. both these are cute alone and also with a little sweater or denim jacket. i haven't washed them yet but i imagine washing on delicate with a good gentle detergent will keep them looking nice for a long time.	1
Gorgeous color! salmon not pink though! lovely soft drape fabric but the itty bity thread and hook in the center is awful! i am a size 2/4 d cup and ordered a small and the closure is not adequate at all! it looks terrible closed and is too revealing without a cami underneath. does not fit like the model!	0
While overall it's a pretty top, there were a few surprises. the biggest one not listed is that the bottom has a thin elastic band! without it, the top would be wide, longer and flow. in the picture to get it to the length shown, the elastic is pulled up toward the waist. which could work for some, as you can adjust the length into a tucked in look. it could be cut off, and sewn, making a normal flowy top. i am a normal size 6 and the shoulders are off, and the sleeve length is long with elastic	1
"I love rompers and this one is really cute. i usually wear size 12 but should have got a 10, it runs big. it seems too long, and i'm 5'9"". the prints cute but a little blah. i paid $158 which is too much, since i haven't worn it yet, i should have waited for it to go on sale."	1
This product is made of good-quality cotton material. it does run a little large, but it still fits nicely. i like the fact that the design is both on the front and face of the garment.	1
I am two months postpartum and bought this top to have something to wear for a date night. it is so flattering and has a beautiful cut. loose but not baggy or unflattering. i bought a small but could have probably sized down... so there's a decent amount of wiggle room in the sizing. great length for jeans or leggings.	1
"I really like this dress. i'm 5'8"" and about 135 so i bought a small. i am small chested, so i plan on wearing a bandeau bra underneath it because the arm holes are a little low. the material is very nice though. perfect for dressing up with cute jewelry!"	1
This was absolutely adorable on. it does look a bit like a dress but at 5'3 and 118 lbs i am normally a size 4, and needed the 2 in this. it fit so perfectly i didn't consider the petite. i can go braless as it has a well lined build in supportive bra. i purchased both colors and it can be dressed up or down. only draw back is dry clean only. super cute, and i definitely recommend this. cuter in person and on.	1
"This dress has the same bold, great color as the picture. although it has a big ""swing"" to it, because the upper portion is a bit fitted, i don't feel like i look pregnant. the material is extremely well done and i like the above the knee styling. i'm very happy i bought it."	1
